1,Bookclub Wednesday!,84,zx7tnv,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zx7tnv/bookclub_wednesday/,28," Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, [r/history](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/) also has a recommended list of things to \[read, listen to or watch\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist))",1672228813.0,2022-12-28 12:00:13+00:00

So with the prevalence of firearms between the 1700-1800s I know that swords were becoming obsolete well not completely obsolete but more or less slowly fading to the background especially in places like Britain or Mexico during that time

But they were still used for warfare even the later periods of American history like the civil war both Confederacy and the Union still had fencing manuals for Calvary regiments

With this im asking were there any notable swordsmen or fencing masters to come from those periods of early American were any people who got there start during the American revolution particularly or were any emerged from the war any notable examples whatsever 

Edit: I did not expect this to blow up like I figure this question has been ask like billion times so I did not expect this

11,Did Italy made a mistake by joining the Entente in 1915 during World War One?,867,zyhkq3,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zyhkq3/did_italy_made_a_mistake_by_joining_the_entente/,107,"   So, a little background: in 1882, the newly formed Kingdom of Italy joined the alliance between the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, thus making the Triple Alliance. However, this alliance was a defensive one. It stipulated that Germany and Austria-Hungary were to assist Italy if it was attacked by France without provocation. In return, Italy will support Germany, if attacked by France. In case of war between Austria-Hungary and The Russian Empire, Italy promised to remain neutral.

   Although, interestingly enough, in 1902 Italy signed a secret treaty with France, in which both nation promised to not go to war against each other.

   In 1914, when World War One began, Italy declared their neutrality. There were two main reasons: the first reason was that The Triple Alliance was a defensive pact and Italy saw Austria-Hungary as the aggressor that started World War One by declaring war on Serbia and launching an offensive war, thus Italy was not obligated to enter the war and the second was the discontent of Italy in 1908 when Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia. This discontent resulted from the fact that Italy and Austria-Hungary promised to do not change the status quo in the Balkans without consulting each other (to which, Austria-Hungary did exactly the opposite in 1908).

   In between 1914 and 1915, both the Central Powers and The Entente tried to pursue Italy: the Central Powers tried to keep Italy neutral and the Entente tried to make Italy joined the war on their side. In the end, the Entente won, due to Italy signing the Treaty of London and joining the war on May 23, 1915.

   Unfortunately for the Italians, their campaign didn't go as planned. Fighting against Austria-Hungary, they suffered a great loss (in fact, they're greatest lost in the war) at the battle of Caporetto. However, Italy's luck was the fact that Austria-Hungary was their main opponent (an empire that, little to be said, did not performed as expected) and after the battle of Vittorio Veneto in the late 1918 the Austro-Hungarian army basically collapsed, ending Austria-Hungary participation in the war. 

   In the end, Italy was on the winners side, but with a high cost: according to Wikipedia, the Italians suffered as many as 1,052,400 to 1,243,400 deaths (3% to 3.5% of total population). And, to add, Italian's economy was in total ruin. Sadly for the Italians, this is not the end: at the Peace Conference, some of the territories promised to Italy after the war and stipulated in the Treaty of London were given to the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Obviously, this angered and upsetted the Italian population and this deception will be known as the ""Vittoria Mutilata"" (""The Mutilated Victory""). The ""Vittoria Mutilata"" will mark the Postwar Italy and the rise of fascism marked by the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini (which will influence the rise of Hitler in Germany and will mark the first steps to World War Two).

   Now, my question is: did Italy make a mistake by joining the Entente?

   Well, given the circumstances in the year 1915, no. The Entente promised Italy much more territories than the Central Powers, who weren't so keen on Italy joining the war. Given the fact that, at the time, this was the biggest war of all times, the potential of territories that could be ""acquired"" was immense and Italy really couldn't say no if what they wanted was to be one of the most powerful nations, if not of the world, then maybe in Europe. Adding to the fact that maybe if they have refused to participate in the war now (in any of the sides they wanted), later the war situation may not have been so favorable, Italy seemed to do the right thing. I mean, they couldn't have known that their allies will not give the territories they promised.

   And now, there are two options: Italy stays neutral or Italy joins the Central Powers. In my opinion:

1. **Italy** **stays neutral -** For me, this is not really a possibility. Why? ""Given the fact that, at the time, this was the biggest war of all times, the potential of territories that could be ""acquired"" was immense and Italy really couldn't say no if what they wanted was to be one of the most powerful nations, if not of the world, then maybe in Europe.""
2. **Italy** **joins** **the Central Powers -** Again, pretty improbable: let's not forget the fact that Italy was still upset after the annexation of Bosnia, the fact that the territories that were promised to Italy were ""extremely wanted"" by them, because of the number of Italians inside the borders of Austria-Hungary (in 1910, there were roughly 800,000 Italians in Austria-Hungary). Of course, let's not forget the secret treaty with France. So, I think, at the time for Italy it was a lot more easy and a lot more conveniently to join the Entente.

   For me, the story of Italy in the First World War is a very dramatic one. Motivated to enter a terrible war (in fact, the most terrible war at that moment when it comes to the victims and the impact it had on the world at the time and in the future) by the prospect of gaining more territories and the status of ""one of the most powerful countries in the world"", Italy ends up as the most unlucky of the winners. Cheated at the Peace Conference, with a general dissatisfaction among the population, a ruined economy, the weak government that tried to maintain the power was quickly changed with an authoritarian one led by the first European dictator of the XX century: Benito Mussolini. He will guide Italy to an even more terrible and devastating war.  
   Maybe things would have looked different (in a better way) if Italy joined the Central Powers. It's difficult to say if the Central Powers would have won the war with Italy by their side. All we can do is to imagine scenarios that are just possibilities. Certainly, France would have had an even more difficult task to defend their country (as it happened in the Second World War). Maybe, if France was conquered, Italy would have gained more territories and the Second World War would have never happened. But this are just speculations and all we have is history and what really happened.",1672350598.0,2022-12-29 21:49:58+00:00

I’ve only watched some of it, but I’m already interested in how historically accurate it would be considered today versus when it was made (in the 2000s). One of the opening lines said something along the lines of “[some number] of American families moved to the western frontier to settle virgin land…”

“Virgin” land? I’ve only read a small portion of the book “Why You Can’t Teach United States History without American Indians,” but I’ve read enough to find that statement concerning. So far there’s basically been no mention of Native Americans in the series. 

So here’s my question, given the changes in how history is addressed today versus the 2000s, what was left out in terms of historical accuracy in this series? Clearly homesteaders did not wander west to find a completely uninhabited expanse.",1672195019.0,2022-12-28 02:36:59+00:00

Zenobia was similarly allowed to retire peacefully to Italy. The name of another, perhaps a Gallic chieftain who fought Rome, escapes me, but he too retired to the Italian countryside after I believe giving a speech on the Senate floor.

20,Hong Xiuquan’s vision of god led him to rebel and establish his own kingdom,41,zw56oc,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zw56oc/hong_xiuquans_vision_of_god_led_him_to_rebel_and/,8,"The Heavenly King of Great Peace, as he was named. Hong Xiuquan the leader of the Taiping Rebellion in the early 19th century of china, who claims to have visions of God, as he described him fairly with a golden beard calling Jesus the “older brother of Hong” making of Hong the Christ’s younger brother and the son of god. Hong Xiuquan is a revolutionary phenomenon in the old days of the chinese empire, unemployed and a frequent failure in the civil service examination, which was the civil bureaucracy made by the ruling dynasty, Qing. Hong failed the test for the fourth and final time, and was in a state of deliria. By trusting his faith, and believing that god was on his side, Hong began his rebellion against Qing dynasty. 

The uprising Hong Xiuquan established his own kingdom with a population of about 30 million and named it “The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom”. With the help of the poor and the religious community, Hong made his own rules to serve every marginalized one of his people, for a start, women were officially able to take the civil service examination and for the first time there were women officers and military leaders. He also outlawed slavery, sex work, alcohol and opium. Although he changed the community for the good to its people, some of his trades were extreme and suppressed. Men and women were separated and even the married one can’t live under the same ceiling due to his religious beliefs. 

In 1847 Hong began his adaptation of, as came to be known, “Authorized Taiping Version of the Bible"" and he presented it to his followers as a version of the authentic religion that had existed in ancient china before it was changed by the Confucius and the imperial system.

The fall of The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was in 1864, Qing forces had invaded the kingdom after hearing about the death of Hong Xiuquan, that happened due to a food poisoning, although some stories proclaim that it was suicide. Qing forces exhumed, beheaded, and cremated Hong Xiuquan's body, and the ashes were blasted out of a cannon, in order to ensure that his remains have no resting place as an eternal punishment. 

This was only a summary of whom this Hong Xiuquan was, but his story is much more interesting than my boring way of telling. The chinese history as a whole is worth your reading, although it’s a journey, but im willing to continue it anyway.",1672111088.0,2022-12-27 03:18:08+00:00

Something I noticed was that her parents were protesting against the ruling Shah, in hopes to see the country adopt democracy, and from the sounds of it so were many of their friends and acquaintances as well. However the outcome of the revolution was instead the creation of an Islamic republic lead by Ruhollah Khomeini after a national referendum. In the comic Marjanes parents say they didn't vote for the Islamic republic and neither did any of their friends, implying that the referendum was illegitimate.  


As far as I can tell Ruhollah Khomeini was genuinely a very popular figure, as he was welcomed back into the country by cheering crowds, but was that entusiasm extended to his ideas on governance? I can't seem to find any sources talking about what the people of Iran truly wanted. Persepolis makes it seem like the populace wanted a democracy but the referendum says otherwise. It did seem like Marjanes family was fairly wealthy and well educated which would explain their more liberal views, but considering the resistance to the new regime lasting for decades and all the way to present day, I can't be sure if people wanted it as much as the referendum says they did.

Anyway, I always heard that one of the reasons why swords are so iconic in pop culture is the fact that they were really expensive to produce and tended to be more useful as backup weapons, specially in the middle ages. That's probably one of the reasons the weapon became so associated with the archetype of the noble knight, which helped it become so iconic.   


I understand that, in the time of the Roman Empire, swords would be much more useful as a main weapon, because armor wasn't so advanced, but that doesn't explain how did they manage to outfit most of their soldiers with gladii. I mean, they're still swords, they still require a lot of material and a lot more work to be made than, say, a spear, which is already an amazing weapon.",1671727552.0,2022-12-22 16:45:52+00:00

38,Bookclub Wednesday!,79,zripzg,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zripzg/bookclub_wednesday/,36," Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, [r/history](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/) also has a recommended list of things to \[read, listen to or watch\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist))",1671624010.0,2022-12-21 12:00:10+00:00
39,How were early Victorian Steam Locomotive Drivers trained and Recruited?,466,zr09tm,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zr09tm/how_were_early_victorian_steam_locomotive_drivers/,16,"I know that traditionally, boys were recruited onto the steam railway at the age of fourteen as engine cleaners with only a basic education. After a year or so of laborious engine cleaning combined with general shed duties, such as assisting the boiler-smiths and fitters, they would be examined and passed out by a locomotive inspector as being fit for firing duties. Now re-classified as Passed Cleaners, from this point on they could be used by the shed foremen as firemen on such workings as local goods trips or yard shunting. Eventually a cleaner would obtain a full time fireman’s appointment and after many years would gradually rise through the ‘links’. Most of these boys were also the sons of pre existing Drivers. However as far as my research suggests this very formal system only emerged in the late 1860s onward, so how did the early 1830s driver’s come about? I’m going to guess perhaps they came from the Mills which used static steam engines, and Ive read an account of a 15 year old porter in 1841 being offered a position of a fireman on the Manchester and Liverpool Railway so perhaps it was some for of recruits just being found around the yard but I’m not sure.

40,Why didn't the US adopt the STG-44 after WW2?,80,zr3sct,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zr3sct/why_didnt_the_us_adopt_the_stg44_after_ww2/,93,"The STG-44, created by Germany during the Second World War, was the first ever assault rifle in the world. We know that the Germans surrendered in 1945, and large stockpiles of weapons were presumably left behind, including STG-44s. Furthermore, US soldiers must have captured some STG-44s from killed German soldiers, and reverse engineering the assault rifle technology must have been possible due to the United States' massive industrial capability.

Today, we know that automatic rifles are a staple of modern militaries, and the Soviets knew that during the late 1940s with the AK-47. However, the US military still used the semi-automatic M1 Garand several years after the war, and then replaced it with the M14, which was capable of automatic fire but was unreliable and uncontrollable when used that way. Only until the Vietnam War (30 years after the end of WW2 and the developments of the STG-44 and AK-47) was the M16 introduced.

So, I'm kind of confused on why the US didn't adopt the STG-44 after WW2. Surely it must have been an improvement over previous weapons and the US would have been able to reverse engineer and mass produce the weapon.",1671580254.0,2022-12-20 23:50:54+00:00

43,Operation Overlord - Allied invasion of Normandy,85,zqicsa,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zqicsa/operation_overlord_allied_invasion_of_normandy/,51," 

Operation Overlord was the code name for the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II. It was one of the largest amphibious military operations in history, and it was a crucial turning point in the war. The operation was led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower and involved the landing of over 150,000 American, British, and Canadian troops on the beaches of Normandy, France on June 6, 1944, also known as D-Day.

The operation was carefully planned and involved a complex network of naval, air, and land forces. In the months leading up to D-Day, the Allies conducted a number of deception operations to mislead the Germans about the location and timing of the invasion. On the day of the invasion, the Allies faced heavy resistance from the German forces, but they were able to establish a foothold on the beaches and push inland.

The success of Operation Overlord was a major turning point in the war and allowed the Allies to begin the liberation of Western Europe from German occupation. It was a costly operation, with over 9,000 Allied soldiers killed or wounded, but it ultimately proved to be a decisive victory that helped bring an end to the war in Europe.

The meeting between Oppenheimer and Truman did not go well.  It was then that Oppenheimer famously told Truman that ""I feel I have blood on my hands"", which was unacceptable to Truman, who immediately replied that that was no concern of Oppenheimer's, and that if anyone had bloody hands, it was the president.  Oppenheimer felt as though the future was in the balance, and that the American government was using/would use the bomb as a political tool against the Soviets. 

Truman had very little use for Oppenheimer then--little use for his ""hand wringing"", for his high moral acceptance of question in the use of the bomb, for his second-guessing the decision.  Cold must have descended in the meeting, as Truman later told David Lillenthal of Oppenheimer that he ""never wanted to see that son of a bitch in this office again"".  Truman would retell the story in different ways, but with generally the same result, waxing about how he dismissed the ""cry-baby scientist.""",1671462585.0,2022-12-19 15:09:45+00:00

47,Greek Hinduism - any surviving legacy?,1102,zowtl7,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zowtl7/greek_hinduism_any_surviving_legacy/,80,"I've been interested in the overlap between Hellenistic philosophy and Buddhism for a while. Some of the parallels are coincidental in that humans happened to have come up with the same ideas at different times - but some are direct. Greek Philosophers such as Pyrrho really did bring back eastern ideas to Greece and wrote extensively about Buddhism. Alexander the Great founded a number of Greek states in the far east occupying territory as far east as what is today Pakistan, and parts of India. A number of Greek elites such as Heliodorus actually converted to Hinduism, while Menander I converted to Buddhism. The first-ever statues of Buddha were commissioned by Greek converts, as this had not been an eastern practice prior to that (look up some of the examples if you're not familiar, it's really interesting to see Hellenistic depictions of Buddha).

As far as I understand, the Greeks added the Hindu gods and mythology to their own existing pantheon of gods, and this whole belief system collapsed along with the greek states a few decades/centuries later. What I wonder is whether any of the cross-pollination went the other way - could there be any traces of greek mythology or greek gods within the many demigods and deities of contemporary Hinduism? or did any survive for a while afterward?",1671363971.0,2022-12-18 11:46:11+00:00

49,The story of Damon of Chaeronea at the time of Lucullus & Sulla [1st half of the 1st c. BCE]; as told by Plutarch in the late 1st c. CE [Cim. 1-2]. An ancient counter example of social banditry? Or just a primitive early case?,49,zp7zro,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zp7zro/the_story_of_damon_of_chaeronea_at_the_time_of/,0,"When it comes to essays and treatises about 'social banditry' \[starting with the Hobsbawm's ones\], the majority of the discussed examples that I've seen, seem to be dated since the 17th-19th c. A usual starting reference in these works could be the case of Robin Hood as a noble robber. Some fewer works are examining earlier incidents, especially within the Roman empire; where for example the case of Bulla Felix \[early 3rd c. CE\] could meet the criteria of a 'noble bandit' by some authors \[eg. Grünewald \[2004, p. 136\] [in books.google](https://books.google.gr/books?id=cfYw_aTUrmsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA136#v=onepage&q&f=false) \].

The following story of Damon is narrated briefly as a local oral tradition of Chaeronea, only by Plutarch \[Cim. 1-2\], who was also a native of the town. Damon can't easily be considered a 'noble' bandit; however some similarities and doubts are appearing...

\[here's a short free rendering by me; a 1914 translation by Bernadotte Perrin with no different meanings can be read in [perseus](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg035.perseus-eng1:1) \].

>Damon of Chaeronea was orphan and a descendant of a respectful & maybe noble family. Plutarch describes him as handsome with strong spirit, but uneducated and harsh. At young age he became the object of the lustful desire of a Roman military commander, who, being unable to gain Damon's love by words and gifts, was willing to use violence. In front of this fear and by anger, Damon along with 15 companions murdered the Roman in the market-place and fled. Soon after, the council of Chaeronea decided to execute the outlaws, but the latter reacted almost immediately killing the magistrates too.  
>  
>Lucius Lucullus happened to be at these places at the time and investigating the Roman's murder, concluded that the Chaeronean citizens weren't guilty; and so he left.  
>  
>Damon in the meantime had started to commit robberies and raids at the Chaeronea's country. So the citizens sent embassy calling him back, appointing him gymnasiarch of Chaeronea. But afterwards they murdered him in the vapour-bath of the city. Plutarch isn't clear if this was the plan from the beginning. Nevertheless the place was considered haunted since then, and thus was walled up; stories & beliefs that had survived till Plutarch's time \[i.e. for at least 150 years\].  
>  
>Right after Damon's death, the nearby rival city of Orchomenus took the chance to accuse the whole Chaeronea for the murder of the Roman. But Lucius Lucullus testified in their favour and saved Plutarch's native city; an act for which he was praised.

This story lies curiously as an anecdote at the start of Plutarch's parallel lives for Greek Cimon & Roman Lucullus. Beck \[2007, p. 64\] writes that this ""proem serves an important purpose in setting up negative behavioral models against which the positive aspects of Lucullus and Cimon are better able to be appreciated and evaluated"". However we should not forget that Plutarch was part of the Greco-Roman world, far away from the conflicts of the early 1st c. BCE; the years of the Mithridatic wars.

So briefly the possible elements regarding social/noble banditry.

* Damon is a descendant of a renowned/noble family.
* He starts his outlaw activities as a 'victim of injustice'; though the Roman didn't manage to use violence first.
* He's mentioned murdering only local authorities who seriously challenged him; i.e. the Roman and the Chaeronean magistrates who condemned him to death.
* He then commits robberies, but there's no mention of redistribution.
* He seems enjoying some acceptance, at least at the beginnings by his 15 companions.
* He seems living among his co-citizens Chaeroneans for some time; though it's unclear if this invitation was made with ultimate goal his murder.
* He is surely tricked and murdered.
* His story surely passed into the oral tradition, even if Plutarch mentions only the ghost part.

Unclear for me.

It is mostly the part of the acceptance by his co-citizens Chaeroneans that causes me thoughts. And seems somehow necessary; according to Hobsbawm \[1981, p. 17\] [in books.google](https://books.google.gr/books?id=0rVNXz-WhhwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT24#v=onepage&q&f=false) the social bandits ""*are considered by their people as heroes, as champions, avengers, fighters for justice, perhaps even leaders of liberation*""; while Grünewald \[2004, p. 93\] [in books.google](https://books.google.gr/books?id=cfYw_aTUrmsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q&f=false) writes that they ""*are ones whom legendary tradition has transformed into folk heroes*"".

According to Plutarch Damon was invited by the 'citizens' \['πολῖται'\] of Chaeronea, as a seemingly immediate result of his robberies and raids; thus it's implied that their interests could have been harmed. This part couldn't be the poor. Then they murdered him, while it's unclear if this was the plan from the beginnings.

Further, there's no exact date for these incidents, however Lucius Lucullus was in Greece at the time, so it should be during 1st-3rd Mithridatic wars \[Perrin is giving 74 BCE with question mark\]. And we can also remember the involvement of some Chaeroneans in the 1st Mithridatic war, fighting on the Roman side; as narrated by Plutarch \[eg. Sull. 16.8, 17.6, 18.1\].

On these Giroux \[2021, p. 187\], though seems sceptical to a degree, is giving the following interesting aspect citing Mackay:

>""*In a very thought-provoking article concerning the political changes of Chaironeia during the Mithridatic War, Christopher Mackay argues that the Damon narrative represented changing political power in the small town. When Damon was invited back in, he asserts, it was because an anti-Roman faction gained control and must have dismissed the charges of murder against Damon as well as removed the pro-Roman faction. When it was clear that Sulla would win the war, the town then murdered Damon, and possibly others, in order to show their support. The community thus rallied together to downplay events and to make them personal rather than political, hiding any disloyalty to Rome by altering the narrative by omitting the political shifts and the possibility of multiple actors beyond Damon. If this was the case, we can interpret Plutarch’s silence on the changing allegiances of his hometown as a covert silence to set aside a troubling past, one based on political hindsight. For, as Plutarch himself said, '...a well-timed silence is clever and more powerful than any statement' (De lib. ed. 14 \[10e\]).*""

but with the footnote:

>""*We have to keep in mind, however, that we do not have any direct evidence from Plutarch or Chaironeia that can support this argument. For example, it is possible that the Chaironeians recalled Damon for practical reasons, namely, to stop him from ravaging the countryside (Cim. 1.6). Nonetheless, it is notable that Plutarch did not relate why Damon was recalled but instead moved past this. In either case, it appears that Plutarch preferred to present the story of Damon and Lucullus from the point of view of individuals and in an indirect fashion, as a tale reflective of Chaironeia’s loyalty to Rome*"".

57,What's your opinion on King Carol II of Romania?,16,znseoj,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/znseoj/whats_your_opinion_on_king_carol_ii_of_romania/,1,"   Personally, I've seen so many hate comments about him and his reign, but I do not think of him as a bad king. I mean, you have to consider that his reign was between 1930 and 1940, which was, little to be said, a turbulent time in history (Hitler's raise to power, the Great Depression...). Sure he was a person that wanted to be and to have absolute control and ironically, that's the thing that ""killed"" his reign (in my opinion), but his power was contested constantly between 1937 and 1940 due to the rise of the extreme right movements and he wanted to keep the monarchy and his power intact.  

   He was extremely interested in culture, supporting writers and arts in general, wanted to modernise and industrialise the country (which he did in broad lines), gaved the women the right to vote. Let's not forget some important monuments and bulidings that were built during his time: King Michael I Park (even though now it is named after his son, this park was initially known as Carol II Park), Arcul de Triumf (was finished in 1936), The Royal Palace of Bucharest, Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum in Bucharest and many others. But, of course his rule has had issues: Camarila Regală (basically a group of corrupt people who were the favorites of Carol II and influenced the country during his time), the authoritarian regime he installed between February 1938 and September 1940, poor management when it comes to the external policy (which I don't think it is entirely his fault due to the circumstances and the European situation in that moment, but, as a absolute monarch between 1938 and 1940, he had the power to do basically everything he wanted, so he could have done better), his decisions to give up one third of the country's land without even fighting (I know the decisions were ratified every time after the Crown Council of Romania, but ultimately, he had the power to do as he wished, despite the decisions taken in the Crown Council and I do realise that the situation was not so easy, in fact, it was one of the worst moments in Romania's history, but to give up one third of your country without even fighting was a bit of a coward move and this shortened his time as king) and countless and countless discussions and scandals about his relationship with his mistress and future wife, Elena Lupescu (who, is said, had a huge influence on Carol and his decisions). 

   I think two things ruined his reputation: his weakness when it comes to women (which created many stories and gossips and also made him gave up the throne twice: in 1918 and in 1925) and Romania's territorial loses in 1940. We can also add his relationship with Helen of Greece and Denmark and their divorce and his bad relationship with his son, King Mihai I. The fact that his personal life kept interfering with his public figure as a King, as a authority in the country is the main thing that really wrecked his image. 

   As a person, Carol was very complex: we was both extremely intelligent (he knew and spoke four languages: English, German, French and Russian), loyal (when it comes to his relationship with Elena Lupescu), had a strong caracter, ambitious, determinate, passionate in everything about military, charming, an avid stamp collector, a very present culturale figure and an egocentric that always wanted the praise and admiration of others, a liar, a rebel, sometimes a bit of a coward, a person who always wanted to be independent, to have control and demanded complete submission from others, a fan of perfect order, (too) passionate about women. He was a very patriotic person, proud of his country and people, even though there were times in his life when his patriotism was put under doubt. 

   In the end, we must not forget that above all, he was just a human like the rest of us, with his qualities and flaws, that most of the time in his life was put under an awful pressure (as a Crown Prince, an ex Crown Prince in exile who gave up everything, as a King that returned to his country and people, and again, as an ex King in exile, waiting for his glorious return).",1671233506.0,2022-12-16 23:31:46+00:00
58,"""Imperialism"" Before ~16th century?",10,znu954,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/znu954/imperialism_before_16th_century/,18,"Imperialism is often discussed as a specific time period––and often concurrently with colonialism––from about the 16th century to the 20th. It is even broken down into ""Old"" and ""New"" periods which cover the colonization of the New World by European powers and the colonial powers of the post-Industrial Revolution, respectively.

However, we define ""imperial"" in the context of government as *any* system fitting the characteristics of a classical empire: territorial expansion at the expense of subordinate countries and being under the rule of an autocrat (e.g. Emperor). This pretty much includes a majority of historical powers over the thousands of years ranging from the Akkadians to post-War Britain. Even Wikipedia fails to include a section on imperialism predating the Colonial period and limits the ""Age of Imperialism"" to a mere couple hundred years, once again concurrent with colonialism.

Why, then, is imperialism so often discussed alongside colonialism when it has been the dominant system of government for most of human history? Is this political or is there something about the government of more ancient empires that somehow doesn't fit the definition? Why is ""imperialist"" a term commonly reserved for the US and European powers of the past few hundred years when we have asiatic powers like Imperial China or the Ottoman Empire which existed for even longer stretches of time?",1671238859.0,2022-12-17 01:00:59+00:00

I'v been doing some research but I can only find information about World War Two and later armored ranks. I'v learned the following:

  
\- The gunner was the second in command, then the driver, then the loaders.  
\- Tank crews were almost all COs and NCOs  
\- The rank of tank commanders depended on their role in the company

One thing that I would like clarification on is the rank of World War 1 tank machine gunners and engineers. I wonder how the machine gunners and artillery gunners match up compared to the driver and gearsman/engineer.",1671149211.0,2022-12-16 00:06:51+00:00

Europeans, Middle Easterners, and the Chinese especially stand out as making great use of hydropower for mills, forges, engineering work, clocks, automatons, etc. But my searching for West Africa runs into a lot of issues with modern hydroelectric dams and the like obscuring results beyond any simple lack of documentation.

Given the large rivers that flow through Western Africa, I'm curious about the state of their efforts before Colonization.

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, [r/history](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/) also has a recommended list of things to \[read, listen to or watch\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist))",1671019211.0,2022-12-14 12:00:11+00:00
67,"How do countries that lack long, ancient histories and myths (or feel they lack it), or have lost all records of them, compensate for this loss or absence? Can these invented ancient myths become as ""legitimate"" as the truly old histories/myths of countries that have them?",28,zltns8,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zltns8/how_do_countries_that_lack_long_ancient_histories/,25,"I can think of a few countries that have had to deal with this question in various ways, on an individual or society/national level, but I'm curious to see what the general reaction is in such countries.

One is the relatively well known case of **JRR Tolkien talking of his reasons for creating** ***Lord of the Rings*** **and the Middle Earth world**, or at least about his fantasy writing generally. He said in one letter,

>*Also – and here I hope I shall not sound absurd – I was from early days grieved by the poverty of my own beloved country: it had no stories of its own (bound up with its tongue and soil), not of the quality that I sought, and found (as an ingredient) in legends of other lands. There was Greek, and Celtic, and Romance, Germanic, Scandinavian, and Finnish (which greatly affected me); but nothing English, save impoverished chap-book stuff.* ***Of course there was and is all the Arthurian world, but powerful as it is, it is imperfectly naturalized, associated with the soil of Britain but not with English; and does not replace what I felt to be missing. For one thing its 'faerie' is too lavish, and fantastical, incoherent and repetitive. For another and more important thing: it is involved in, and explicitly contains the Christian religion.***  
*For reasons which I will not elaborate, that seems to me fatal.* ***Myth and fairy-story must, as all art, reflect and contain in solution elements of moral and religious truth (or error), but not explicit, not in the known form of the primary 'real' world.*** *(I am speaking, of course, of our present situation, not of ancient pagan, pre-Christian days. And I will not repeat what I tried to say in my essay, which you read.)*

([From Tolkien's **Letter #131**, in an answer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/iuxivg/tolkiens_stated_desire_to_create_a_native_english/))

It doesn't mean he always believed this in the same way his whole life, it could've changed, but Tolkien thought (at least here) that England was missing something like the grand or at least well remembered great epic traditions that other European countries/cultures had. It's one Englishman's response to feeling native England had no great, pre-Christian mythical tradition.

Another case is **the Philippines, where many people believe that a lot of pre-Hispanic/precolonial native cultures, including myths, arts, epic poetry etc. have been lost** **mainly because of colonialism**, 300 years and more of Spanish rule and Catholic conversion, and 50 and more of American rule, plus a lot of disasters and things like the WW2 Japanese occupation and American battles with them in Manila that burned or destroyed a lot of the historical records. As a result there are Filipino responses on the individual/community level (like groups trying to really promote every little thing about precolonial history, or even writing stories in those settings, sometimes passing these off as actual records but which are hoaxes), and on the national/government level (eg. [the **Order of Kalantiaw**](https://opinion.inquirer.net/30125/remember-the-order-of-kalantiaw), an award/title based on stories of a precolonial Filipino chief which however are the work of a early 1900s myth-writer).

I am interested to know how **the process goes of inventing ancient myth in countries that feel like they don't have them or have lost any memory/evidence of them**. I know this is often used to political effect, in the worst case by fascist dictators for example, which is one reason why modern recreation/reconstruction of ancient traditions is often so controversial (another reason is that it is seen as inauthentic or fake, being after all only recently made), but from their point of view, what else will those countries do to prove that culturally they are ""great"" or to be taken seriously? **Can countries that only have recently invented, ""ancient"" native myths, epics, histories, traditions etc., ever become as legitimate as the truly old great myths/histories of countries/cultures that have them?**",1671031106.0,2022-12-14 15:18:26+00:00

70,"I have translated some letters between the khans of Mongolian and Manchus recorded in the Manchus literary sources, pretty funny how they were roasting each other.",202,zkznqy,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zkznqy/i_have_translated_some_letters_between_the_khans/,31,"On the 22nd day of October, Kalka Mongol’s prince Joriktu hvng baturu and other princes sent us a letter:” To Manchu’s Sure Kundulun Khan: we attacked you several times before, and that is all Jaisai‘s fault, you knew that. You said China is our mutual enemy, and we should attack it, that was very true! We would like to cooperate with you till we capture their Shanhai pass. The Buddha and Tengri will witness it if we do not honour these words. Secondly, if you want to make peace with the Chinese, you should discuss it with us first because we also want to be included in the treaty. If the Chinese bribe you without bribing us, you should not accept it, same goes for us. If you can honour these words, your name shall be praised. ” 

Then we heard that Mongol’s Chahar khan sent a messenger named Kangkar Baihv together with the Kalka’s, so we sent them 2 bulls and 2 bottles of liquor. The letter from Chahar khan said:” Baturu Cinggis Khan, the ruler of 40 tumen Mongols send regards to Sure Kundulun khan, the ruler of 3 tumen Juxen(meaning plebs in Manchu) that lived near water:  How are you? China is our mutual enemy, I heard you were raiding them for the past two years. In this summer I also went to Guangning myself, captured the city and imposed a tribute on the Chinese living there. Now you said you are going to attack Guangning, I warn you there shall be some bad consequences. There had been no grudge between us before, but if those Chinese who have submitted to me got conquered by you, My reputation would be damaged. If you choose to not listen to me and follow my order, the Tengri will witness it. In the past years we used to have maintained diplomatic relationships, then I cut it off because your envoys framed me for being arrogant, if you think what I said was right, you should send the previous envoy to me.” After reading the letter, all princes and ministers were outraged, half of them wanted to kill the messenger, other half wanted to cut the nose and ear of the messenger and send him back. The khan said:” You are right to be angry, but that messenger has nothing to do with these, it’s his khan who wrote bad words in the letter’s faults. I’ll make him stay in the court a bit longer, so I can write a reply full of bad words and order him to take it back to his khan.”

On the 7th day of January, the khan sent Chahar khan a reply:” To Chahar khan: you said:(Baturu Cinggis Khan, the ruler of 40 tumen Mongols send regards to Sure Kundulun khan, the ruler of 3 tumen Juxen that lived near water) why would you look down on us in such impolite manner? Because you were strong? I heard that when the Chinese took Khanbali, all 40 tumen Mongols were captured except 6 tumen of them. And you do not even have full authority over all these 6 tumen. The nomads of the right-wing: the Ordos,the twelve Tvmed and the Ingxebu are all free people, they had nothing to do with you. The 3 tumen left-wing Mongols were not all your subjects either. You do not even have 3 tumen Mongols right now and you looked down on us because of the ancient glories of 40 tumen Mongols. Yes, we 3 tumen Juxen were weak, unlike your 40 tumen Mongols and were unaware of your power. So the goddess of lady Abka(sky) and Banamu(land) favoured us and granted us 8 different states to rule. You then said:(Now you said you are going to attack Guangning, I warn you there shall be some bad consequences.) You are right for saying so if we were your enemy, but we were not! Why would you say such bad words to us who were favoured by the goddesses and looked down at us for the sake of Guangning a Chinese city? You would be absolutely righteous to say these bad words if you could retake Khanbali and save the 40 tumen Mongols who were captured by the Chinese, but have you? Before I launched my campaign against China, you, my Baturu Cinggis Khan, had also attacked them twice. The first time you lost all your armours and camels. The second time, Prince Gergen daicing’s guard drown in the water and nearly 100 of your soldiers were captured. Which big city have you taken? Which general have you captured? Which army have you defeated? Why would the Chinese bribe you? It is only because I attacked China, killed all their men and took their women, that the Chinese were scared of me and wanted to hire you as their mercenary against me! China and Korea have different languages but their cultures are the same, thus they treat each other like their own people, and the same goes for you and us. If you are actually a wise man, you should have said:(I have always hated China, I heard you, my brother-khan, are about to attack them, may the divine helps you to take many cities, defeat many armies. And I would also want to join your force, etc). Alas, isn't that good? Why would you harm me and look down on me, a khan who holds no grudge against you and speaks a different language? The Abka and Banamu will witness if it is just because of the Chinese bribery”",1670948518.0,2022-12-13 16:21:58+00:00

The Sure(meaning smart in Manchu)Khan said: ""This time the Chinese army finally came. We got 500 troops on the southern front and it would be more than sufficient. For I know the Chinese came from the south were nothing but bait to lure us. The main enemy force shall come from the west, from Fushun the Chinese city! And we will head there"" He then bestowed the command of the troops in the capital to the princes and ministers and ordered them to set off at 7:00 am. 

During their march, they received an intelligence saying another Chinese regiment was spotted in Qinghe, the Chinese city. The Crown Prince said: ""Qinghe was far away so I will send 200 troops to just delay them. The direction of the main army remains the same."" After the army went through Jaka pass at 11:00 am, everyone put on their armour. Then in Hejige, a certain man reported: ""The Chinese army saw our transportation troops climb up the Girin Mountain in Jaxehexen, and they are besieging our camp on the mountain now ."" When the army arrived at Jaxehexen at 1:00 pm, they found 20k Chinese soldiers besieging the construction site of our new capital, our transportation troops were camping on the top of Girin Mountain, and another Chinese regiment was stationed on the top of Sarhv Mountain. The 400 cavalries that had been sent to reinforce the troops before had successfully sneaked from the Chinese detection and followed them from Sarhv to Jaxehexen Ferry. And our troops on Girin Mountain conducted a strike against the surrounding enemies and killed hundreds of them. 

Speculating this, The crown prince told the princes and ministers: ""That 400 cavalry and our transportation troops have joined each other in Girin Mountain. Now we’ll send an additional 1,000 armoured elites to break through the encirclement and climb up the mountain, then they shall attack the enemy together from there. After that, we will send the four banners of the right wing to help them, while the four banners of the left wing remain in their spot to keep an eye on Mount Sarhv.” Then the Sure Khan arrived, and he said, “It’s 5:00 pm, and it’s already getting dark, the four banners on the left wing should raid Mount Sarhv instead, if we defeat Chinese on that mountain, the morale of the enemy soldiers in Jaxehexen will be shaken.” 

So he ordered one banner of the ring wing to join the left, and ordered the other three banners to monitor Jaxehexen. The plan was that after the enemy of Sarhv was defeated, the three banners of the right wing would support our troops on Girin Mountain when they charged down.（see the rest of the text in the comment section)",1670830901.0,2022-12-12 07:41:41+00:00

This subject seems to be adressed in
'From social to surgical: Historical perspectives on perineal care during labour and birth' , Hannah G. Dahlen et al., (Woman and Birth 2010), (https://scholar.google.nl/scholar?q=From+social+to+surgical:+Historical+perspectives+on+perineal+care+during+labour+and+birth%27&hl=nl&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart  - pdf cannot be downloaded on phone), but on closer inspection the authors only write about the history of the episiotomy (a medical incision of the vagina/perineum), specifically that it was first written about in 1742 by Sir Fielding Out. I do believe that stitches logically follow a episiotomy, but stitches can be done without an episiotomy (when the perineum tears), but I cannot find anything on that historically. 

One of the  main subjects of the article I mentioned is the transition from the traditional (early) modern midwife to the 'man midwife'. Could it be possible that these early modern midwife stitched, since medical stitching goes back thousands of years (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_suture).

The event that I am referring to is the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. This document, which was signed by King John of England and a group of rebel barons, established the principle that even a king was subject to the law. It marked the beginning of the rule of law in England, and laid the foundation for modern democratic principles.

The Magna Carta was a revolutionary document for its time, and it had a profound impact on the course of history. It was one of the first times that a group of people had stood up to a monarch and demanded that their rights be recognized and protected. This was a bold and daring move, and it paved the way for other movements that sought to limit the power of rulers and protect the rights of individuals.

In addition to its historical significance, the Magna Carta is also interesting because of the many ways in which it has been interpreted and used over the centuries. It has been cited by leaders and activists throughout history as a justification for their actions, and it continues to be an important symbol of liberty and democracy.

In conclusion, the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 is, in my opinion, one of the most interesting events in history. It was a revolutionary moment that changed the course of history and laid the foundation for many of the principles that we hold dear today. Its impact continues to be felt today, and it will continue to be remembered as one of the most important events in the history of human civilization.",1670716216.0,2022-12-10 23:50:16+00:00

https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15310/the-late-bronze-age-collapse-c-1200---1150-bce/

Looking at the map I see there was a substantial amount of movement from Central Europe. Looking into various sources such as the Metropolitan museum in NYC I found there was a major culture shift at the same time in Europe as well, including a change in burial practices and religious beliefs, as well as a massive increase in metal working and advanced weaponry. To me it seems that whatever happened in Europe to drastically alter their culture led to migration and the ""sea people"" that contributed to the collapse of Bronze age civilizations. Does anyone have more information about what specifically occurred in Central Europe around 1200 BCE, and is there a correlation between the two as I am lead to believe?

As a bonus question is there a list or map out there that shows the order and probable dates each city collapsed? Much appreciated.",1670540081.0,2022-12-08 22:54:41+00:00

87,"Why is the Spanish colonial empire often said/implied to be ""less focused on trade"" or ""not prioritising trade"" compared to other empires like the Dutch, British, Portuguese etc.?",366,zfpp4q,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zfpp4q/why_is_the_spanish_colonial_empire_often/,54,"Every large empire has to rely on trade some way or other, even/especially empires like the European/Western ones in the age of colonialism/imperialism.

I'm Filipino so we were a Spanish colony for 300 years and more, and I keep noticing when reading our history that in terms of trade as a goal, the Spanish empire is often negatively compared against the Dutch, British or even the Portuguese, the other large European empires that rose up around the same time or slightly later. In other words the Spanish are often said or implied to focus (much?) less on trade/commercial reasons as an ultimate goal for expansion, or trade was (much?) less a priority for them.

TL;DR, **Is it true then that the Spanish empire, in most of that time,** ***really saw trade as a lesser/secondary priority or focus***, **compared to other European colonial empires that were its competitors? If this is so then why?**

Of course this isn't an all-or-nothing claim. I know that trade *was* at least a little bit of a goal even for Spain because again, no large empire could do without even a little focus on it. One non-religious reason they went to the Philippines was to get to the spices in the Moluccas, and another non-religious reason they stayed and named it is to trade with China, hence, well, the 200-year galleon trade. But somehow even with these, **commerce is still often described as ""less"" of a priority for the Spanish crown, especially compared to its commonly stated goals of Christianising its colonies.** *That* often gets the lion's share of attention compared to purely commercial activity, and maybe it's one reason that the Spanish are not often thought of/stereotyped in popular imagination as *traders/merchants*, unlike say the Dutch or even to an extent the British.

Then there's the whole silver thing in Latin America, which it seems little or none of the other empires had access to, so maybe this also had something to do with why Madrid wasn't as ""trade oriented"", beyond extracting the silver and then at best shipping it to China through Manila, which again the galleons helped in.

Maybe, if we cover late imperial Spain too, we can also factor in changes in colonial priorities over decades and centuries of imperial rule. In the early 1800s they opened the Philippines to world trade, for example, but even that didn't seem to benefit Spain itself much because other countries just put up commercial interests in the islands like the British, Germans, Americans and Chinese. Still this was also after most of Latin America got independent, and after the first 200 years of Spanish rule to begin with.",1670475969.0,2022-12-08 05:06:09+00:00

91,An essay on The Harlan County War,977,zeeppp,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zeeppp/an_essay_on_the_harlan_county_war/,80,"Hello folks. I'm an avid history buff, and I love to write. So I decided to pen an essay on one of the most interesting labor-related pieces of US history, Bloody Harlan: AKA The Harlan County War, an important part of a much larger, countrywide series of conflicts known as The Coal Wars which took place largely from 1890 to 1930. This series of skirmishes and strikes, lasting from early 1931 into 1939 and taking place in Harlan County, Kentucky, began because of the Harlan County Coal Operators' Association’s (HCCOA) decision to cut miners' wages by 10%. The miners, impoverished due to their already low pay (this coming in the form of company scrip, room, and board), decided enough was enough, and some of them began to join with the United Mine Workers of America, in an attempt to unionize. The company took issue with the unionizing of its workers and began firing any known members of the union and evicting them from their company-owned homes. Not long after the company began firing union members, miners began to go on strike in droves.

At the height of the first strike, over 5,800 miners were on strike, with only about 900 strikebreakers, also known as Scabs, working the mines. During this period, the strikebreakers were under protection by “mine guards”, deputized private guards working under Sheriff John Henry Blair, an arguably corrupt, inarguably nasty man whose allegiance lay with the company. Minor skirmishes, in which striking workers and law enforcement officers exchanged shots, were a regular occurrence. The bloodiest of these conflicts by far was The Battle of Evarts. On the morning of May 5th, 1931, striking miners lay in wait near the Evarts railroad, ready to ambush the motorcade that was carrying goods to the strikebreakers working the mines. The motorcade was made up of three cars, with a sheriff's deputy in each. As the motorcade approached the concealed strikers, a single shot rang out. As with many of these types of conflicts, both sides blamed the other for firing first. What followed was pure chaos. Approximately 1,000 shots were fired, and the three deputies were killed along with a single striker. This incident caused strikes to become larger and more common in the Harlan County area. After The Battle of Evarts, the Kentucky National Guard was called in. The strikers thought they had come to protect them, but instead, they had come to replace the deputized guards and protect the strikebreakers and break the pickets.

On May 24th, the KNG tear-gassed a large union rally, and Sheriff J. H. Blair rescinded the constitutional right to assemble in Harlan County. The strikes in Harlan County lasted about a month and a half after the battle, with the majority of workers back to the mines on June 17th and union membership dropped significantly, due to the Coal Companies refusing to offer concessions and the Red Cross offering no aid to the starving strikers on the grounds of neutrality. Eight of the strikers were found guilty of conspiracy to murder due to the action on May 5th, and all eight received life sentences.

A few organizations made a play for Harlan County, including the openly communist National Miners’ Union. The NMU was a small success, opening soup kitchens around the county and convincing some of the miners to join up, but the majority were disillusioned with workers' unions by that point. The NMU organized strikes and pickets in multiple counties throughout Kentucky, and while some were minor successes, their attempts in Harlan County were utter failures. The final straw was when some labor organizers, most being clergy members, learned of the NMU’s leaders' animosity towards religion, and denounced the organization. In the wake of this, the organizer of the Young Communist League, Harry Sims, was killed in Harlan County. Due to the clergymen's denouncement of the NMU, already dwindling membership became near nonexistent which forced them to close their soup kitchens due to lack of funding, and the Red Cross stepped in to feed and assist the miners that had been blacklisted from working the mines due to previous or current union membership. 

On June 16th, 1933, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) came into effect, which, among other things, outlawed workplace discrimination based on union membership. After this, over half of Harlan County’s coal mines (the ones owned by the HCCOA) were operated as “open shops” (a place of work that allows union membership but does not require it) from October 27th, 1933 to March 31st, 1935. Despite headway by the unions, the battle for Harlan County between labor and capital continued in earnest. Sheriff Blair was voted out of office in 1933 and died in 1934, replaced by T. R. Middleton, a candidate who ran on a pro-union platform. The Kentucky National Guard was once again called in on December 8, 1934, requested by UMW organizers who had been threatened by bosses and deputies. The troops promptly escorted the union men to the county line. As national political support for the NIRA dwindled, capital gained the upper hand, and when the United States Supreme Court struck down the legislation's pro-union National Recovery Administration portion, shops with union presence in Harlan dwindled from eighteen to one. 

The NIRA was not very effective in Harlan County, whereas the Wagner Act of 1935 was very effective in terms of hindering the operations of the county's mine operators. The new law outlawed several tactics used by coal companies, including yellow-dog contracts, company unions, and discrimination based on union activity. While coal companies across the nation responded positively to the legislation in 1935, Harlan remained resistant to federal involvement. On July 7, a group of deputies became angry at a public celebration of the Wagner Act and began beating several miners. 

1935 was a turbulent year even for Harlan; troops were deployed three times to maintain order in the county. On September 29, troops were dispatched to the Harlan County War for the first time. The governor referred to the beatings and harassment of the miners at the hands of the mine guards as ""the worst reign of terror in the history of the county"" was made. He stood up for and protected the miners despite the fact that a bomb had killed Harlan County Attorney Elmon Middleton several weeks earlier. 

This formative, tumultuous period of our history, colloquially known as the Coal Wars, lasted from 1890 well into the 1930s, officially coming to an end in Harlan County in 1939. This long, bloody series of strikes and conflicts helped to show the importance of workers’ unions, labor laws, and fair treatment in the workplace.

94,Why is it that the life of William the Conquerer seems to be taken from a drama tv show?,80,zdvjdm,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/zdvjdm/why_is_it_that_the_life_of_william_the_conquerer/,39,"Now here me out, recently I've been reading on the life of medieval kings and historical figures. But as I was reading about the life of William the Conqueror (the one that will rule England) I've realised just how similar his life is to a tv drama.

His mother for instance was a commoner, literally a leather tanner that his father an actual noble had a relationship with. In fact due to the fact that he was pretty much a bastard, he was ridiculed a lot in his youth about being the son of a leather tanner.

Then when he was older but not come of age yet, his father then left for the crusade and never came back due to being dying in the journey. Now William was the heir to his father's title and wealth however like a good story his status as a noble was of course being challenged by many people due to his half commoner bloodline.

Seriously people were fighting for his father's title so bad that many times he was being targeted for assassin's. Many of his caretakers that was supposed to groom him to pick up his father's mantle was assassinated trying to get to him. One instance, his caretaker and William was sleeping in a room but ever the cautios fellow he had slept on the bed and told the young Lord to sleep on the floor so assassin's would since the bed was more likely to be a target. Low and behold he was correct and got attacked that night by an assassin trying to get to William.

Do you see now how similar to a tv drama this guy life was? You get an underdog character that's a bastard to a powerful title but was challenged it all through out his life due to his so called commoner lineage.

Then once he becomes of age and took his father's title as Duke, he of course became a violent man. He had seen death, backstabbing and many more killings in his life so much that he had grown to be this violent and ruthless figure that gave no mercy to his enemies. In one scene, he was besieging one castle and the defenders of the castle mocked the William by putting cow hides on the castle wall mocking him of his Bastard and commoner lineage. Then like any good tv drama, of course William gets his revenge, once he managed to take over the castle he skin the people who mocked him alive.

After that was of course his love life. Being a Duke of course it would be beneficial for him to marry the a noble lady so that they can combine their resources together. So he chose Matilda of Flanders and have even send her a letter for hand in marriage. But this is a drama you see, of course she would reject the proposal. In fact she even mentioned that she wouldn't marry a bastard like William.

This of course enrages William so much that depending on the sources he either went inside the Flanders castle and beat up Matilda or he saw her attending church and pull her of her horse by her pigtails and threw her into the mud. Now Matilda was a short woman you see, she was only 4'11 while William was 5'10, so yeah she had no chance against this violent man. But like any drama of course the protagonist action was seen as a positive thing, since in both accounts Matilda would agree to Williams marriage proposal. Nothing more romantic than a man that shows his passion by beating you up I guess.

Ironically enough, their marriage actually worked. You'd expect it all to go wrong since he beats her up but hey his life is a Tv drama remember. Not only he loves his wife dearly, he had 9 kids with her and most of their kids was born before she reached 35 years of age. To give you a perspective the day they Wed, William was 24 meanwhile Matilda was 20. Not to mention unlike his father, William never had any mistresses at all not even a bastard. Which is surprising for a man that successfully taken England from the Saxon. In Matilda death bed William even vowed to stop hunting a favourite pass time of his to grieve his beloved wife.

So what can we learn? William the Conqueror life is literally a TV show drama but in reality. You get a guy that's a bastard and half commoner and had to fight all the way to adulthood. This violent man heart was only melted by his short wife who he loved very dearly.",1670301574.0,2022-12-06 04:39:34+00:00

The western half of Mesoamerica is treated with a huge amount of specificity; being split into many cultural groups/kingdoms such as the Mixtecs, Purepechans, Zapotecs, Yopitzinco, Otomies, Totonacs, Nahuas etc...

And then being further divided, with the Nahuans being split between the Mexica, Tepanecs, Acolhua, Tlaxcalans etc...

All of these just being the ones that existed at the time of the Spanish conquest.

There seems to be endless division amoung the western Mesoamericans, and a strong resistance to any sort of umbrella term to group these people together.

In the eastern half of Mesoamerica however it's just... Mayan. 2500 years ago? Mayan. At the time of the Spanish conquest? Still Mayan.

I know that they are broadly split into the Yucatec, Kekchi, and Mopan Mayans whose languages were not completely mutually intelligible, but there still seems to be a striking lack of cultural diversity compared to what was going on in the west.

And the thing is that the Mayans weren't all that politically united at all. There was never a single dominant Mayan kingdom or empire that united the area to standardize things.

So, how did this happen? What were the Mayans doing that kept their culture so homogenous over such a long period, that clearly wasn't being done by Teotihuacan or the Toltecs in the west whose empires seem to have faded and left almost no mark on the cultures that follow?

Or perhaps my question should be, how did the Mayans, despite never having a large united empire, so effectively displace / eradicate / assimilate any other cultures from their part of the world to create a vast and mostly homogeneous culture in a way not achieved by any of the large empires in the west that would seem better suited to such a task?",1669909454.0,2022-12-01 15:44:14+00:00

I'm interested in learning more about company towns, primarily the coal-mining towns of Appalachia in the 1900s-1930s (although if anyone has any relevant insights about other times and/or places, please share!). Particularly in places where the company owned the houses, the company store is the only store, workers are paid in scrip, the next town is hours away by train, etc.

What was the relationship like between company bosses/administrators and resistant workers? What methods did workers use to resist company power, both openly and covertly? What about family members of miners who, themselves, did not work for the mine? How did bosses try to counter that resistance? I'm familiar with Blair Mountain, but are there any other stories I should look into?

Thanks!",1669732796.0,2022-11-29 14:39:56+00:00
116,"A summary of Ilya Ivanov's ""humanzee experiments""",2018,z72n0q,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/z72n0q/a_summary_of_ilya_ivanovs_humanzee_experiments/,273,"In the 1920s, a Soviet biologist named Ilya Ivanov tried to crossbreed humans with various other primate species. He was responsible for groundbreaking breakthroughs with artificial insemination. With Ivanov’s use of artificial insemination, he was able to use a stallion's sperm to fertilize up to 500 mares. Most stallions could only father 20–30 mares through natural mating.

This made him popular among horse breeders, who came all across the globe to work with him. He had more ambitions then just horse breeding, and his interests revolved around hybridization between species. More specifically, Ivanov wanted to see if humans could reproduce with their closest known relatives.

Ivanov decided the best route to take with his project was to inject several female chimpanzees and orangutans with human sperms. He started his experiments when they were green lighted by the Soviet Department of Scientific Institutions in 1926. None of his subjects succeeded in becoming pregnant.

Undeterred, Ivanov then tried to experiment with human women and ape sperms. However, he wasn't able to put his plans into motion from both opposition from his superiors and the death of his last orangutan ""sperm donor."" Any further tests were prevented when Ivanov was hit by a purge and ended up exiled and imprisoned in what is now Kazakhstan.

I heard some very sensationalist rumors that he was somehow trying to build ""super soldiers"" for the Soviet government (something that a History Channel ""documentary"" Monsterquest touched upon). However, evidence for this is nonexistent, and I've heard more plausible reports that Ivanov's intentions was to discredit religion.

Ivanov’s “Humanzee” experiments are one of the little known but fascinating stories of the dark side of science. His works sound like something out of B-graded horror movie. I find it fascinating about how different the ethics of science was during the 1920s then today. On a side-note, I wonder how the world would have reacted if Ivanov’s experiments successfully made a hybrid offspring?

Obviously, for this question we can exclude the cultural change (industrialisation and huge advancement of technology etc.) that happened the last centuries.

E.g. the Guran tribe of Kurds goes ultimately back to the Iranic tribe of the Avestan people of ca. 1200 BC and has kept the language (continuously the same) and all the core aspects of culture. Its the oldest continuously living group. Arguably with the Yazidi Kurds and perhaps with the Indo-Aryans too. Since the Egyptians became assimilated to Arabs in language and culture and the Greeks became Christians (change of culture). I am not knowledgeable about the Chinese in this case. Ive only taken some information from Wikipedia. The **Han** Chinese people are not as old as the Indo-Aryans or as Guran either. Am not sure how the Chinese prior to the Han are connected and/or interrelated with the start of the Chinese from the Han dynasty onward.

Interesting facts about them as well as the roles of Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, Che Guevara and the historical forces that drove these events.",182,yztzlf,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/yztzlf/the_trials_of_the_cuban_revolution_interesting/,26,"One major feature historical feature of the Cuban revolution and its aftermath are the political trials and executions that took place. They are both well known and little understood historically at the same time. So here are some interesting historical facts surrounding these events.

**The crimes of the Batista era, the Law of the Sierra, and the influence of the legal precedents of Spanish Law and Nuremberg**

* It is well known that Castro and Che came into power overthrowing another dictator named Fulcencio Batista. According to analysis done by various groups, including the CIA at the time, ""*It \[was\] estimated that roughly 20,000 politically inspired murders and deaths during revolutionary action occurred during Batista's last term in office--March 1952 to 31 December 1958*""(Political murders in Cuba--Batista Era Compared with Castro Regime, January 1963 CIA memorandum)
* This background is itself important because according to studies done on this period, ""*During the rebellion against Fulcencio Batista's, the general command of the rebel army led by Fidel Castro introduced into the liberated territories the 19th century Penal Law commonly known as Ley de la Sierra. This law included the death penalty for extremely serious crimes whether perpetrated by the dictatorship or by supporters of the revolution. In 1959 the revolutionary extended its application to the whole of the republic and to war criminals captured and tried after the war of liberation. This latter extension, supported by the majority of the population, followed the same procedures as the trials held by the Allies in Nuremberg after World War II*""\_Ramon Treto Gomez(Thirty Years of Cuban Revolutionary Penal Law, pg 115-116)

**Out of the three, Che Guevara was surprisingly the most moderate when it came to the trials of that era**

* Che Guevara has the reputation of being the most hardline out of those who led the Cuban revolutionary movement. In some respects he definitely was the most ideological compared to Castro, but when it came to the trials of the post revolutionary period he was surprisingly the most ""moderate"". Raul Castro at the time was the most ruthless in terms of being least likely to preside over trials that had due process. Fidel Castro presided over trials that typically involved bombastic speeches accompanied with calls for ""to the wall"" for the accused, which was pretty much a show trial.
* Che Guevara surprisingly by contrast did not presided over bombastic, show trial like judgements. According to scholars analysing this period, ""*He went over the cases with the judges and reached his final verdicts coldly and neutrally, on the basis of evidence alone. According to Borrego, Che too great care in selecting judges and prosecutors. For instance, rebels who had been mistreated were not allowed to pass judgement on their former torturers. 'There were sometimes prosecutors who were on the extreme left' Borrego explained. 'One had to moderate those who always asked for the death sentence*'""\_Jon Lee Anderson(Che, pg 371)

**Both Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolutionaries were driven by the pressures of public opinion**

* Scholarship on this period universally agrees that the trials of the Cuban revolution had public support. ""*There was little overt public opposition to the workings of the revolutionary justice. On the contrary. Batista's thugs had committed some sickening crimes and the Cuban public was in a lynching mood. Newspapers were full of morbid revelations and gruesome photographs of the horrors and brutalities that had taken place under Batista. Bohemia published snide interviews with suspects awaiting trial and provided sanctimonious captions to pictures of the executions*""\_Jon Lee Anderson (Che, pg 372)
* But it was simply that there was public ""support"" for the trials of the Cuban Revolution. There was in many cases active public pressure on the revolutionaries. Scholarship shows that ""*Despite the impression the U.S. media gave of the executions, there were some efforts to formalize, and even slow down, the trials. For example, on January 16, Raúl Castro announced that trials would be temporarily suspended in order to put together more convincing evidence against the defendants. The pace of executions may also have slowed as invitations were extended to several U.S. congressmen to attend the massive January 21 rally. As Castro warned, “Be assured that we are going to be much more benign than what the people want. . . . f we follow what the people want, we would have to shoot all the informers, which is a considerable quantity, but you can’t. One has to punish the exemplary cases, the minimum. For the rest, there are other punishments. Not everyone has to be shot'. But the public often felt the sentences were not harsh enough. As a tribunal member, Orlando Borrego, later recalled, people “thought the sentencing was too benign. . . . Sometimes one asked for \[a sentence of\] ten years and the people wanted it to be twenty.” Toward the end of the month trials were again delayed, and now appeals were permitted in all cases. Again the delays caused consternation, and soon new legal steps were taken to hasten the trials: the constitution was altered for ninety days in order to hasten detentions; prisoners were now allowed to be tried in any part of the island, not simply where the alleged crime had taken place; and six new courts were created in Havana to try war criminals.* ***Meanwhile, local protests continued. In Manzanillo, when two soldiers received prison terms instead of death, and one corporal was acquitted, the decision sparked a two-day riot. In Santiago the acquittal of a notorious man provoked tumultuous protests; and when the Tribunal Superior de Guerra overturned the death sentence given by a local tribunal in Pinar del Rio, sentencing the three defendants to prison sentences instead, public outrage took on ominous overtones, including veiled references to the potential such decisions had to breed counterrevolution***""\_Michele Chase(A Century of Revolution: Insurgent and Counterinsurgent Violence During Latin America's Cold War/The Trials: Violence and Justice in the Aftermath of the Cuban Revolution, pg 182-183)
* Essentially what was said above was that when Castro would give a sentence that was considered not sufficiently harsh enough, he would face a backlash from the public which sometimes in some provinces in Cuba turned to protests and riots. Continuing in this vein the scholarship also states ""*In February 1959, in several towns in Oriente Province, local anger over what were considered insufficiently harsh sentences developed into organized protests, including a brief transportation strike and declarations to a local newspaper. Two rebel army commanders were sent to stop the disturbances and release a statement of warning '\*****The problem posited by the people of Palma Soriano, protesting because Revolutionary Justice is being applied slowly and benignly \[con mucha demora y benigdad\] has served to allow Contramaestre to use the same incorrect procedure \[protests\]. . . . We say it is incorrect because they are using the same demagogic methods from 20 years ago, using public agitation to get attention. \[But\] a popular government, a government whose leaders cannot be called politiqueros or demagogues, a government that is resolving as quickly as possible all the problems brought on by the disintegration of a corrupt state, a government that loves liberty, respects individual rights, and is incapable of using public force against the people, because it emerged from the people . . . a government like this cannot be blackmailed with demagogic protests, disturbances of public peace. . . . We responsibly demand . . . that there be no more acts such as those in Palma and Contramaestre. \[We ask that\] when some injustice is committed, you go to the corresponding organisms, and you will see that justice will be done quickly****.*""\_Michele Chase(A Century of Revolution: Insurgent and Counterinsurgent Violence During Latin America's Cold War/The Trials: Violence and Justice in the Aftermath of the Cuban Revolution, pg 183)

**Historical memory of Cuban and Latin American history influenced the decisions of the trials**

* For the Cuban revolutionaries historical memories would have had an impact on the trials of this era though for Fidel Castro the memories emphasized would have been slightly different from Che Guevara. Castro and the Cuban revolutionaries when conducting the trials of the Cuban revolution would have looked back to the events of 1933. Whats' called the Cuban Revolution of 1933. After the resignation of Cuban President Gerardo Machado, dissatisfaction grew with the provisional government that came after him. Essentially in the ensuing chaos that took place mob justice prevailed where the people took things into their own hands which created chaos and instability.
* Castro and the Cuban revolutionaries look on those events of the past in the 30s and it informed their decisions. They saw the political trials as a way to appease the people in order to prevent the chaos of past days from re-emerging, as mentioned. This perspective is affirmed in the scholarship that states ""*Those who were in Cuba then were well aware that if the revolutionary government had not at that moment applied severe legislation against the few hundred torturers, bombers and other brutal criminals long employed by the Batista regime, the people themselves would have taken justice into their own hands, as happened during the anti Machado rebellion, and thrown society into chaos*""\_Ramon Gomez Treto(Thirty Years of Cuban Revolutionary Penal Law, pg 116)
* For Che Guevara the emphasis would have been on his experiences in Guatemala and Argentina. Lets remember he was the international revolutionary of the group who famously travelled across Latin America on his motorcycle. Che was present in Guatemala during the Guatemalan revolution of Jacobo Arbenz in the 1950s. The Eisenhower Administration, defending the United Fruit Company, initiated a coup detat to overthrow Arbenz's regime. The key to the success of the coup was flooding the radio waves with propaganda and disinformation, and also getting key generals of the military to betray Arbenz, leading to his overthrow. Che was determine not to let that happen again. So to prevent a potential coup Che supported government control of the media to prevent CIA disinformation tactics as well as the trials of the revolution to purge the military of factions that could be used for a coup.
* Che's experience in Argentina was also a factor as well. It should be remembered that he was Argentine. And for most of his life till his early twenties he lived in Argentina. This included WWII. It is well known that after WWII Nazi war criminals and collaborators escaped the Nuremberg trials. And one of the destinations they headed to was Latin America, specifically Argentina under Juan and Eva Peron's government. The trials of the Cuban revolution took place 14 years after Nuremberg. In living memory. And just like how Nazi war criminals fled across the atlantic there was a fear that Batista war criminals would flee across the Caribbean(which they did).
* What's interesting to analyse in all of this are the motivations and perspectives. The memories of both of them would have been known to both and would have influenced both. But they emphasised different memories still. Castro approached the Cuban revolution's trials from a nationalist perspective. Che Guevara from an Internationalist perspective.",1668914923.0,2022-11-20 03:28:43+00:00

How does one explain the existence of similar cultural motifs or architectural edifices (or even construction techniques) which are found around the world?

As far as I know, in mainstream archaeology, there are two main frameworks in operation; which are diffusionism and evolutionism.

Diffusionism suggests most of the important innovations and advances in human culture occurred only once and were transmitted by contact to other areas.

Evolutionism suggests that similar developments in different places are due to the like working of minds under like conditions.

I am wondering if there are any other mainstream ideas which offer another perspective to this issue?",1668888084.0,2022-11-19 20:01:24+00:00

# 23. Japan wins the Russo-Japanese War; Korea loses its diplomatic sovereignty to Japan 

* In 1905, however, an abrupt geopolitical turn (not just for Korea but for world history) occurred:
   * **Japan defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War.** ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War))
      * Before, Korea had allied with Qing China to counterbalance Japan. After China was defeated by Japan, Korea allied with Russia. However, now that Russia was defeated by Japan (which no one had expected), Korea was left alone with no allies.
   * **This was something no one had really imagined.** Korea's foreign policy to ally with larger continental powers such as China and Russia was a rational one. However, **Japan's modernization and military reform turned out to be really effective in a way that no one had expected**.
* The 30 years of Joseon Korea's reform (1874 - 1905) helped the Korean elites become better prepared for a wave of modernization. However, despite all the efforts, **Korea failed to raise patriotic military elites**.
   * It seems that **many of the early ""traitors""  were military men**. Those who opened the gate for the Japanese assassins who murdered the queen were the military men trained and funded by Japan.
      * Japan had also been funding [pro-Japan organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iljinhoe), winning over those had had grievances in the traditional Joseon society (e.g. illegitimate sons)

&#x200B;

* **Japan–Korea Protectorate Treaty of 1905** ([Eulsa Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1905))
   * In November 1905, almost immediately the Russo-Japanese war, Japanese soldiers encircled the Korean palace. The Japanese President of Council (former prime minister) [Ito Hirobumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C5%8D_Hirobumi) entered the palace. He gave a [treaty document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1905) to the king (now emperor). It was **a treaty that would make Korea a protectorate of the Imperial Japan and deprive Korea of its diplomatic sovereignty**. The king refused to sign.
      * Given what happened to his late wife, I think the king was ready to be killed.
   * Instead, the Japanese President of Council found 5 Korean cabinet members who were collaborative, and had them sign the treaty. The five would be remembered in Korea as [Five Eulsa Traitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eulsa_Traitors). They were all given titles and positions by the Imperial Japan later on.
      * On a side note, Japan had secretly made an agreement with the US. In the [Taft-Katsura agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Katsura_agreement) (1905), **Japan and the US endorsed each other's dominance in Korea and the Philippines**.

&#x200B;

* **Korean Reactions to the Treaty of 1905**
   * The sign of the *Eulsa* treaty in 1905 **shocked the nation again**, after the queen's murder. In the following 5 years, public outcry, revolts, and assassinations ensued. Well-known events:
   * 1905: **A famous editorial ""I Wail Bitterly Today""** ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Wail_Bitterly_Today)) was published in the newspaper [Imperial Capital Gazette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwangseong_Sinmun), immediately after the sign of the treaty.
      * *Nara ireun seorum*, ""the grief of loss of the country,"" became a dominant sentiment in literature and folk culture soon
   * 1905: [Min Young-hwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Young-hwan), the queen's relative and the most important member of the Min clan who dedicated himself to reforming Korea, **committed suicide as a protest to the treaty**
   * 1906: The first modern Korean novel, [Tears of Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinsoseol), was published. It blamed old customs and superstitions, and urged the nation's awakening
   * 1907: King Gojong desperately looked for diplomatic channels, and **secretly sent three envoys to the Hague Convention at Hague, Netherlands**. However, they were treated as uninvited members, and Korea was no longer viewed as an independent nation.
   * 1906\~1910: Attacks and assassination attempts for the ""Five Traitors"" took place. Some of the five were severely injured.
   * 1907\~1909: Some of the former Korean army soldiers, peasant rebels (e.g. there was an army leader named ""[stone-stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Dol-seok)"" which indicated low birth), tiger hunters, miners, etc. joined t[he Righteous Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Righteous_army). They had **a war with the Japanese army for two years**, with over 17,000 righteous army soldiers killed and 37,000 injured.
      * The remainder of the army and leaders **fled to Manchuria** (modern-day China and Russia border region) to continue their battles, comprising the first generation of Korean diaspora in Manchuria.
   * 1905\~1909: By 1905, there were **a few thousand Korean immigrants in Hawaii and San Francisco** \-- mainly Christians who were introduced to the US by American missionaries as laborers. The immigrants were greatly shaken by the news of the treaty. In 1909, the leader of the Korean immigrant community, [Ahn Chang-ho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahn_Changho), founded an organization named [Korean National Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_National_Association), which would become an important apparatus for independence movement of Korean diaspora.
   * 1907: [Pyongyang Revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang_Revival). A large-scale, historic **evangelical revival** happened in Pyongyang. A collective expression of **extreme sorrow and repentance** dominated. A missionary mentioned that it was a terrifying scene. Also, an American [missionary described](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/evangelical-history/the-north-korean-revival-of-1907/):

>Someone began to weep, and in a moment the whole audience was weeping. ... My own cook tried to make a confession, broke down in the midst of it, and cried to me across the room: **“Pastor, tell me, is there any hope for me, can I be forgiven?” and then threw himself to the floor and wept and wept, and almost screamed in agony**. ... \[The whole scene was\] something indescribable. Again, after another confession, they would break out in uncontrollable weeping, and we would all weep, we could not help it. And so the meeting went on until two o’clock a.m.

&#x200B;

* 1909: **The assassination of Ito Hirobumi, the first governor of Korea** who forced the Korean court to sign the treaty. [An Jung-geun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Jung-geun), now considered as a patriot hero in Korea, fatally shot Ito at a railway station in Manchuria.
   * He didn't want to be remembered as an assassin or terrorist, but wanted to be remembered as a honorable prisoner of war. He announced 15 reasons why Ito deserved to die
      * the first reason was the murder of the queen in 1895.
   * He also had famously **cut off the last joint of his ring finger in a blood oath to kill Ito**. It was very noticeable in his jail photos, and his handprint was very distinct. He used his handprint as his personal signature.

# 24. The emergence of Korean ethno-nationalism

* **The emergence of proto-ethno-nationalism**
   * At this point, Koreans were watching the world they knew fading away. The deeply isolated hermit kingdom was going through a painful identity crisis unseen from the outside world.
   * ""Ethno-nationalism"" sounds a bit demonic in English language, but here I'm just going to show how it emerged in Korea as a reaction to imperial aggression. It's interesting that in light of modern scientific knowledge and methods, **some Korean scholars almost immediately started investigating their ethnic roots**. I checked what's the definition of ""ethnicity,"" and found out that Herodotus in the 5th century BC already gave a [definition of ethnic identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group#Definitions_and_conceptual_history). It is:
      * shared descent (ὅμαιμον – homaimon, ""of the same blood"")
      * shared language (ὁμόγλωσσον – homoglōsson, ""speaking the same language"")
      * shared sanctuaries and sacrifices (Greek: θεῶν ἱδρύματά τε κοινὰ καὶ θυσίαι – theōn hidrumata te koina kai thusiai)
      * shared customs (Greek: ἤθεα ὁμότροπα – ēthea homotropa, ""customs of like fashion"")
      * **all of which had existed for at least a millennium** in the Korean peninsula.
   * The neo-Confucianists in the past were not very interested in studying the linear timeline of history. Famously, when King Gojong encountered an antique [Goryeo-ware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goryeo_ware), he said ""this is not from my country.""
      * However, it does not mean that they were not aware of the historical continuity of Korean ethnic kingdoms from the distant past. The name of the kingdom *Joseon* itself came from the name of the first ancient Korean bronze-age kingdom *Old Joseon* ([Gojoseon](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/x3ot4p/korean_history_dates_back_to_a_bronze_culture/)). A 15th century [fantasy novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geumo_Sinhwa) tells a tale of a spirit from the *Old Joseon*, indicating Joseon Koreans' awareness of their distant ethnic past
      * **Ancient ruins and old Buddhist relics were strewn in Korean countrysides and mountains.** Koreans knew that those ruins had been made by their direct ancestors. Seoul (*Hanyang*) was a relatively new city (still 500 years old), but people knew that cities like Pyongyang had existed from the immemorial past. Lots of folktales and shamanic songs told the stories of their ancestors from *Goryeo, Silla*, or even before.
      * So, Koreans already had a sense of the shared distant past, and a sense of ethnic continuity. **The idea of race and ethno-nationalism imported from the 19th century Europe resonated very strongly with Koreans**, the same way it deeply resonated with the Japanese.

&#x200B;

* [Ju Si-gyeong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ju_Si-gyeong), **the first linguist of Korea**, founded the Korean Language System Society in 1886, and studied **Korean parts of speech and writing system**. Later he studied **phonetics and grammars**, and published many books in the 1910s.
   * It seems that he also translated [History of the Loss of Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Loss_of_Vietnam)

&#x200B;

* National Anthem ([Aegukga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegukga) \- ""**The Song of Loving the Nation**"")
   * The lyrics of the current Korean national anthem is traced back to the end of the 19th century. There were many different versions sung by different groups of people (court officials, military, social clubs, etc.) but it seems that most of them shared the following stanza:

>**Hibiscus, over a thousand miles, splendid mountains and rivers**  
>  
>**People of Joseon, ever may preserve her.**

* [Hibiscus syriacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibiscus_syriacus) (*mugunghwa*), a type of hibiscus native to Korea, later became a national symbol of Korea. It is said that hibiscus functioned as a natural pesticide (attracting aphids and insects), so often planted next to rice fields, along with willow trees that purified water. Hibiscus is resilient and blooms a long time, so later it became the symbol of Korean resilience.

* Folk anthem: [Arirang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arirang)
   * Arirang is the most representative Korean folk song that had been sung in all provinces with 60 versions and 3,600 variations. Most scholars seem to agree that the first Arirang came from [Jeongseon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeongseon_County) county, deep in the mountainous province [Gangwon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangwon_Province,_South_Korea). A theory says that the song spread across the country via laborers in Seoul in the late 19th century.
   * While the melodies and lyrics differ across versions, all include a variation of a refrain ""Arirang, arirang, arariyo,"" and **the theme of sorrow, separation, reunion, and love**.
   * This would later evolve into an informal anthem for Korean resistance.
   * In 1896, an American woman with a degree in Native American studies met three Korean students who were studying at Howard University (they had been studying in Japan, but upon the news of the queen's murder and king's exile in the Russian legation, they left for the US). She recorded a version of Arirang sung by them.
      * I found a [video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnno4mRKBl8) of her recording (song starting at 6:33). While the song featured in this video is not Arirang, it is very interesting to hear how an ordinary scholar-aristocrat Joseon man, wearing a Western suit, sings in this very ancient way.

&#x200B;

* [Sin Chae-ho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_Chaeho), **the founder of ethno-nationalistic historiography of Korea** (*Minjok Sahak*). He first developed his interest in history by reading Italian history and literature such as Dante.
   * Just looking at the titles of his early newspaper columns is interesting:
      * Relationship Between History and Patriotism (1908)
      * The Hero Yi Sun-sin (1908)
      * The Oriental Italy (1909) - he might have considered Korea as ""the oriental Italy""
      * The Introduction to Ancient History of Tan'gun (1912)

&#x200B;

* **The concept of** ***Minjok*** **(ethno-nation) -** [Korean ethno-nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_ethnic_nationalism)
   * Shin was the person who popularized the term *Minjok* (same as Japanese [minzoku](https://sociology.iresearchnet.com/sociology-of-race/minzoku/)) in Korea. It is often translated as ""race"" or ""nation,"" but I think that the most accurate translation is ""ethnic nation"" or ""ethno-nation.""
   * The concept influenced the development of [**Juche**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche) **in North Korea,** and also **blood and soil nationalism in South Korea**. Present-day North Korea emphasizes:

>**one bloodline, one land, one language, one culture of our monoethnic country, which has lived in purity**

* The idea of *minjok* further developed under the Japanese colonial rule and after the Korean War. I can't describe the whole [nation-building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation-building) or [state-building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-building) process of modern Korea(s) here in this post, I would just mention a fact:
* the **Korean language is the largest** [**language isolate**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate)**,** i.e. a language that is not part of a larger language family. This gave Koreans a mysterious feeling about their language and ethnic origin, which led to lots of [bizarre pseudohistory](https://www.jedleahenry.org/korea-now-podcast/2020/1/2/the-korea-now-podcast-64-andrew-logie-korean-pseudo-history), some of which are still influential.

&#x200B;

* Mount Baekdu as a national symbol
   * It's a mountain at the Korea-China border (9,000 ft)
   * Shin made some pseudo-historical arguments that Koreans and Manchus were of a single race, and [Mount Baekdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paektu_Mountain), the spiritual mountain of Manchus, is also a spiritual mountain for Koreans. This idea was further developed later, and now Mount Baekdu is considered ""**the spiritual mountain of** ***Minjok*** **(ethno-nation)**"" by Koreans. It is considered a sacred site by both North and South Koreans
   * A web of mountain ranges is now called [Baekdu-dagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekdudaegan), and is considered to carry ""***Minjok*** **spirit**"" or ""***Minjok*** **energy**."" Interestingly, an [American author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Mason) made a thorough introduction online to Korean mountain sanctuaries, mountain ranges and the ethno-national spirituality ([website](http://www.san-shin.org/)).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well ""ethno-natioanlism"" sounds demonic in English language, but it was a resistance theory in Korea. The Japanese had their own version of [ethno-nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Japan), strong [ethnic body politic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokutai), and the theory of inferiority of the Korean and Chinese race (and others).

From the 1930s on, the Korean ethno-nationalism would be severely oppressed under **the Imperial Japan's ""cultural assimilation"", or ""cultural/ethnic annihilation""** [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_genocide#Asia)**.** Koreans were forced to [change their names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%8Dshi-kaimei) into a Japanese one, speak Japanese at school and in media, worship Shinto gods (Japanese indigenous religion), etc.

Linguists were punished for doing research on the Korean language; poets were punished for writing poems in Korean. [An executed poet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yun_Dong-ju) famously sang in 1941:

>**With my heart singing to the stars, I shall love all things that are dying** ([poem](https://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/y01bwi/poem_foreword_by_yun_dongju_1941_in_the_1930s_and/))

which implied the perishing of the Korean language and ethnic culture. Thus, Korean ethno-nationalism gained **the status of martyrdom**.

* Many Koreans still get extremely emotional about this topic -- commonly called ""***Minjok*** **emotion**."" It is commonly said that ""our spirits (*hon, eol*) were being taken away.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Many non-ethnic-Koreans who observe Korea now criticize the ethno-nationalism. [An American professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Reynolds_Myers) criticizes that both South and North Korea is not founded on universal values such as republicanism or communism, but the ideology of ""blood and soil nationalism"" -- one bloodline, one language, one land.

What is my stance as an ethnic Korean who lives abroad? I would just quote a Bulgarian-French author's observation here:

>**The (French) condemnation of attachment to national values changes significance according to whether you live in a small country placed in a sphere of influence of a larger one** … or you live abroad in a larger country where you are sheltered from any threat by a more powerful neighbor. **Paris is certainly a place that favors the euphoric renunciation of nationalistic values. Sofia, much less so**. (Todorov, 1994, Bilingualism, Dialogism and Schizophrenia)

I think this applies to America and Korea, too.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Do these ""ethnic emotions"" come from one's bloodline? Race? Genetics?

I found [a very interesting book](https://www.amazon.com/RITUALS-SEPARATION-Korean-Identity-Belonging-ebook/dp/B01MQFLWDK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=I3KOLFHETUKA&keywords=rituals+of+separation&qid=1665607664&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjAwIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=rituals+of+separation%2Caps%2C273&sr=8-1) written by **a blonde, white American woman who grew up in Seoul** between the age 0 to 16. Even after she returned to America with her missionary parents, **Korea was her motherland, even her spiritual home**. She pours out her ""ethnic"" knowledge and feelings and emotions she absorbed as a child. **The helplessness that the nation felt**, **the collective ache** Koreans feel about their history and culture. Interestingly, she talked a lot about the same historical knowledge that I laid out in this long series of Joseon posts.

Reading this book, I was thinking that what makes me feel the way I feel is not my race or blood, but the deep and intimate knowledge that I hold dear to my heart about the language, history, and culture of the nation.

closing episode: 

# 25. Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty of 1910

* By 1910, there were already about 170,000 Japanese nationals living in Korea. These settlers had already begun to colonize agricultural land in Korea - the methods were similar to what was used in other colonies. **Traditional ownership of land by Korean farmers or tenants was denied if there was no written or legal proof**, and such lands were taken and handed over to Japanese individuals or corporations. By 1910, about 5\~8% of arable land of Korea had already come under Japanese control. By 1930, it soared to 50%.
* Judging that the time was ripe, **in 1910, Japan annexed Korea**. That was the official end of the 500 years of the Joseon dynasty, and the beginning of a painful journey of Korea into the modern world.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\---------------------

The next phases in Korean history are:

* the 36 years of the Japanese colonial rule of Korea \[1910-1945\]
* US-Soviet occupation \[1945-1948\]
* Election in the US-occupied South and division \[1948\]
* Korean War \[1950-1953\]

I'm not sure if I will write further -- the modern history is better known to the outside world, and English sources are abundant. Plus the story is very dark. Joseon was dark enough lol.

&#x200B;

* Just one thing I want to briefly mention is that **about 20\~25% of North Korean population were wiped out during the Korean War** ([NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/world/asia/korean-war-history.html)). Napalms were dropped upon cities and civilians in the US air raids, and only a few buildings were left in the ancient city Pyongyang. More civilians died during the Korean War than in the Vietnam War. But somehow the Korean War became ""forgotten"" although many of the US operations could be considered war crimes
   * Regardless of how terrible the North Korean regime is now, this should be remembered.

\---------------------

The history and culture of Joseon is not well known to the outside world, but is crucial to understand the modern South and North Korea. This series got really long but I hope this has provided a good overview.",1668305365.0,2022-11-13 02:09:25+00:00

Also, please, let's just focus on the inner workings of one culturally coherent society. The numerous (and often bloody) consequences of a society meeting another with different one only right definition of morals is covered in many other sources.

My point is - in monotheistic (and if I understand it correctly to some extend in Hinduism too) religions, the deity is unified with whatever are considered the virtues of the society

The god in monotheistic religions is the (body-less) embodiment - or the very definition - of what is right.

The priestly caste then could draw their authority from the claim, that since they have higher knowledge of the deity, they can be arbiters of morals. It gives a guidance to asses whether a priest is a good one or bad and can serve as a basis for discussion about what role religion should have in politics and other questions.

In Greek and Roman religions, the gods are pretty much just humans (with both human virtues and failings) with superpowers. But how did their stories relate to anything going on down on Earth? And why would any power derived from them give you any authority over other people? What did Greek and Roman priests even do? And why?",1668113102.0,2022-11-10 20:45:02+00:00

&#x200B;

So far my account of Korean history has not deviated a lot from conventional narratives in Korean history textbooks and the popular discourses. However, this section might be a little bit different.

I took an equivalent of AP Korean History when I was a high school student in Korea. I learned about a long list of events between 1850-1900 including a coup, riot, rebellion, murder, and exile, but they all looked random to me. In this post, I argue that **all these events are best understood when one considers Queen Myeongseong (aka Queen Min), the wife of King Gojong, as the most influential court politician of the time who set out the direction of opening and reform**.

The version of the story that is commonly remembered by the Korean public is as following:

* 1. King Gojong was a weak man, and he was under the influence of his father and his wife. His father was a strong man, and his wife also had a strong personality.
* 2. His father and his wife didn't get along well.
* 3. The queen (his wife) lavishly spent the nation's wealth, but she was a pitiful queen at the end of the day, because she was violently murdered by the evil Japanese.

&#x200B;

This narrative does not highlight the fact that

* **1. The queen was the one who ended the 10 years of extreme isolationist, conservative policies driven by her father-in-law**
* 2. **She was the one who drove the subsequent 20 years of opening and reform of the country.** She was the one who opened up the border and invited Western missionaries to build modern hospitals and schools
* 3. **She also had a keen sense of diplomacy, understood that Japan was the biggest national security threat**, and tried to ally with China (and later Russia) to check Japan's rising influence. **She was consistently anti-Japan**. **This eventually led to her violent murder by the Japanese.**

Serious gender bias played out in her historical evaluation and later public discourses in Korea. She was often accused of being power-hungry, lavish, irrational and domineering, but the records of her contemporaries say that she was an outstanding intellectual and political figure.

&#x200B;

Her story is even more dramatic in a sense that she was carefully chosen as a queen by her father-in-law because she was from a peripheral aristocratic family with no father or brothers who could take power. **Her father-in-law never imagined that the fatherless little girl would grow up to be his most fierce political nemesis**.

**Her changing relationship with her same-age husband King Gojong over 30 years was also dramatic, complex, and multi-dimensional**. They essentially grew up together (from 15 years old to 45 years old), and the king was, in the end, deeply attached to the queen. His famous exile to the Russian ligation is best understood as his shocked reaction to her violent murder by the Japanese, and his will to continue his murdered wife's policy directions.

&#x200B;

Overall, **I think her life is a Netflix show material.** lol. It's a fascinating time and I hope someone will dramatize it.

The following are some of the mentions about her by her contemporaries:

&#x200B;

>As a diplomat, the queen demonstrated outstanding skills. When dealing with the problems of foreign powers and interests in Europe and America, **the queen carefully reviewed each issue and presented her opinions before King Gojong, and her logic was precise and orderly**, and she often impressed foreign diplomats.  
>  
>\- Yoon Chi-ho  
>  
>I was impressed by the queen's graceful and charming manners, her thoughtful hospitality, her superior intelligence and dignity. Although she was communicated to me through an interpreter, her speech was excellent. **I came to fully understand her bizarre political influence, her power to command, not just her king, but many others.** When a conversation started, especially when she became interested in the content of the conversation, her face shone with a dazzling intellect.  
>  
>\- Isabella Budd Bishop, ""Korea and Her Neighbors""  
>  
>At that time, Japan had no choice but to eliminate the empress, a representative figure, to eliminate the possibility of collusion between Joseon and Russia. **She was an outstanding person of her time**.  
>  
>\- Hideo Kobayakawa

&#x200B;

\*\* Disclaimer: The Queen is commonly referred to as Empress Myeongseong in contemporary Korea, because she was posthumously elevated to the status of the Empress in the short-lived Korean Empire (1897-1910) later on. But I think that this is an inflated title -- Korea was never an empire in any real sense, and she was never an empress when she was alive. In this post, I would simply refer to her as ""the Queen.""

&#x200B;

# Phase 5. Into a Frightening New World [1864~1910]

**The Opium Wars were a critical moment** \- everyone was watching what was happening in China. 6 years after the defeat of China in the Second Opium War (1860), **the Japanese reformists would start a dramatic coup and achieve the Meiji Restoration in two years**. From that point, they rapidly adopted Western institutions and modernized their country. This quick transition was enabled by centuries of engagement in international trades, the growth of market economies, and knowledge of the West accumulated from that. Military conscription of the ruling class did not meet resistance.

In China and Korea, such a radical coup did not happen, and the reform was only slowly being introduced by old monarchs and aristocrats. In both countries, reformists had been poisoned, killed, and executed for decades.

The first reform in those countries was military reform, but it was limited to raising an elite military unit with Western weaponry without changing institutions: commonly known as ""Eastern principles, Western tools"" approach. Conscription of the ruling class was unthinkable under the Confucian ideology.

**The ideology that was the foundation of Joseon Korea was failing**, and Koreans would go through painful soul searching and eventual annexation by Japan in 1910.

But there were two important rulers before that: *Daewongun*, a conservative isolationist who was the father of King *Gojong*, and **Queen** ***Myeongseong*** **(aka Queen Min), who would turn out to be the most important reformist politician** in Joseon court (who was originally from a peripheral aristocrat family).

# 19. A royal outsider becomes the Regent of Joseon, and continues isolationist policies for 10 more years [1864~1874]

*Heungseon Daewongun* ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heungseon_Daewongun)), whose birth name was *Yi Ha-eung*, was far in the order of succession in the royal family. It is said that he deliberately acted libertine - drinking a lot, hanging out with commoners, and visiting gisaengs (geisha/courtesan) to avoid attention.

Then **his son** \[[King Gojong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojong_of_Korea)\] **was selected as the next puppet boy king**. *Daewongun* (the father) revealed his true color as an ambitious power-hungry man, and started gaining power as the regent. He effectively weakened the power of the corrupt Andong Kim clan, but he turned out to be **a stubborn guardian of neo-Confucianism and extreme isolationism**. Joseon maintained its reputation as a ""hermit kingdom.""

It was a time when foreign ships started appearing and demanded the opening of ports and trades ([French expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_expedition_to_Korea), [US Gereral Sherman Incident,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Sherman_incident) [US expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_expedition_to_Korea)). China was defeated in the historic Opium Wars. However, *Daewongun* was stubborn and his foreign policy was simply: ""**no treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan.**""

**Koreans were still prohibited from leaving the country** (except for a few diplomats), and all **foreigners were barred entry into the country** except for a few Chinese or Japanese diplomats. ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imo_Incident))

* e.g. Daewongun was furious about a precise map ([Daedongyeojido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedongyeojido)) made by a Korean cartographer [Kim Jeong-ho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gim_Jeong-ho) influenced by Western science 

His most important achievement was the reconstruction of Gyeongbok Palace, which had been destroyed 250 years ago in the devastating war with Japan.

* The Korean public weirdly remembers that Queen *Myeongseong* lavishly spent the country's wealth, but it was actually *Daewongun* who imposed a huge tax burden on the public for this symbolic project of no practical importance (other than being used as a tourist attraction a hundred years later)

>A historian Bruce Cumings notes that \[his reign\] was not a revolution but a **restoration**, as the Daewongun was **attempting to return to the days of King Sejong in the fifteenth century**

Overall, he was a fierce guardian of *Wijeong Cheoksa* (""Preserve the Right, Dispel the Heresy"" - heresy meaning Western science and Christianity). Japan was rapidly modernizing their country in this 10-year time period.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 20. The queen, a fatherless, brotherless 25-year-old woman from a peripheral noble family, effectively expels her father-in-law from power

*Daewongun*, the regent, carefully chose **a 15-year old girl** (birth name *Min Ja-yeong*) **from a peripheral noble family (Min clan) who had no father and brothers** as the wife of his son King *Gojong* (who was also about 15-year-old). He believed that it would prevent any potential [consort kin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consort_kin) problems in the future. It is an interesting irony that, by doing so, he unknowingly chose his biggest political rival in the future.

She was not a particularly feminine or attractive girl, and she did not draw any attention from the boy king for the first 5 years in their marriage. However, **she was intelligent, poised, and had a love for learning**. It is said that her free time was entirely devoted to reading -- she particularly **read books about the ancient history and statesmenship** such as *Spring and Autumn Annals* (the history of competing Chinese states 771\~446 BC), **which were not typically read by women**. In the meantime, the king, a teenager boy, was fooling around with court maidens.

Then a palace maiden bore the first son of the king. It would have been an extremely humiliating and devastating news for a teenager queen. However, she calmly sent a very expensive gift to the mother, and congratulated her husband with a happy face at an official ceremony. The boy king was frightened and surprised. Some say that that was the first moment he ever paid any attention to her.

That said, this was a serious threat because queens not able to bear a son could be expelled from the palace. The queen, like any other previous queens in the court, desperately prayed to the shamanic spirits. Finally, when she was 20 years old, she delivered her first son. However, **tragically and famously, the baby boy was born with an anus deformity and was not able to discharge**. He died in 4 days. Still barely adult, the queen got extremely emotional, cried, and made the whole nation to hear her cry -- by inviting several hundred shamans to sing for the soul of her child for ten days straight, and by ordering thousands of Buddhist monks throughout the nation to pray.

* Unfortunately, the popular memory (before her reevaluation in the 1990s) only focused on this event in her teenage years (""she's irrational and wasteful"")

After all this drama, the King Gojong became an adult, and started wanting to rule as a king himself. But he feared his father, and did not have a political knack to do so. This was the time when the queen started revealing her talent as a politician

By this time, she had already figured out the characters of the noblemen in and out of the court. **She united the men in her Min clan, and started placing them in major court positions. She also won over the people who had been neglected by the Regent** (her despotic father-in-law) -- including the regent's elder brother. The young queen was moving her pawns while birthing children. **When the time was ripe, the king announced that he would take the reign into his own hands, and would not allow his father to enter the court.** His father was effectively expelled.

* But his father didn't just get expelled silently - mysterious explosions and killings happened around the capital shortly after

&#x200B;

# 21. The queen, with the support of her husband King Gojong, drives opening and reform for 20 years [1874~1894]

Soon, she delivered a healthy male heir. This consolidated her status and power in the court. **The young queen and king were now in political symbiosis -- her power depended on her position as the legitimate/primary wife of the king, and his power came from her political intelligence and shrewdness**. They would maintain this idiosyncratic partnership for the next 20 years, until the queen was murdered at the age of 45.

* Many foreigners' records described the queen as ""clever, intelligent, shrewd, and witty"" while describing the king as ""kind""

However, it was not just the symbiotic interests that bound the two. **The two also seemed to share a common vision for opening and reform**.

* Joseon was still a deeply isolated ""backwater"" of East Asia: [For example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ok-gyun), most Joseon scholars have **never seen photographs of the West** before this point. **Such materials had been banned** by the father of the king before. Only a very few fringe figures had access to the outside world.
* Both the queen and king were interested in new materials and knowledge coming from the outside world. It's famous that the king liked coffee, for example. **They knew that the world was changing, and were sympathetic to young scholars' sense of urgency to change and reform**.

&#x200B;

**(1) Opening**

* In 1876, there was a small skirmish between a Japanese warboat *Unyo* and a Korean island fortress. Unlike *Daewongun* (the former regent), the new regime (the queen, king, and their court officials) **agreed to open commerce with foreigners**. [The Treaty of Ganghwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1876) was signed.
   * This was an unfair treaty in the sense that it gave Japan the right to survey and locate two new ports in the Korean peninsula, and it bestowed [extraterritoriality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritoriality) for the Japanese in the special port districts. The Westerners [had forced this to Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Amity_and_Commerce_(United_States%E2%80%93Japan)), and now Japan was doing the same thing with Joseon Korea.
   * However, the Korean history textbooks focuses only on the fact that it was an unfair treaty, ignoring the fact that it was a deliberate political decision made as an experiment.
* In 1880 a [mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Hong-jip) was sent to Japan, and they got a document from a Chinese diplomat titled ""A Strategy for Korea."" China wanted Korea to be modernized to play a role as a buffer zone between China and Japan. The document **recommended Korea stay pro-China, learn from Japan yet maintain a distance, and ally with the United States** to counterbalance Russia
   * The mission also reported that, compared to the modernized and electricity-wired Tokyo and Osaka, Seoul and Busan now looked like vestiges of the ancient past
   * **The queen took special interest in the strategy document, and had copies sent out to all the ministers**. This might have influenced **her life-long diplomatic stance (pro-China, arm's-length relationship to Japan, and alliance with Westerners**)

&#x200B;

During the early changes, **three different political parties emerged**.

# (Party A) ""Dispel all foreigners"" - which was, unfortunately, the most popular approach

# (Party B) Pro-China, arm's length relationship to Japan, alliance with Westerners (Queen's approach)

# (Party C) Radicals (pro-Japan, aiming to imitate the Japanese way) - a rising faction in the court

\*\* some radicals were sincerely attracted to Japan for ideological reasons, but later, some of those in the pro-Japan faction would be deliberately bought by Japan

&#x200B;

**(2) Riot and coup**

In 1881, the court **raised an elite military unit** called [Byeolgigun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Py%C5%8Flgigun), armed with new Western weapons and trained by Japanese officers

However, finance might have been the new regime's weakness. Joseon Korea did not inherit a functioning market economy, and corruption had been rampant at all levels of bureaucracy (legacy from the early 19th century - section 18).

Grievances arose among the old army. Many of them were discharged, and the rest of them did not get enough salary in the form of rice. The minister of treasury, who was a Min clan member, was in charge to pay them, but he was inexperienced and incompetent. A subordinate swindled the rice and replaced it with millet mixed with sand. It got rotten, and foul smelling.

* This infuriated the old army, and they raided the palace ([Imo incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imo_Incident)) - they killed the Japanese, the minister of treasury, and several other high officials. They considered the queen and her clan members as main enemies who prioritized foreigners.
* Opening and reform was not popular among the less educated populace (Party A), especially when it was driven by a woman. The rioters searched for the queen to kill her. However, **the queen disguised as a palace maiden, and narrowly escaped** with her guardians and maidens.

This set back the early reform efforts. When the queen was away, the (more easily pushed around) king signed a[ treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1882) with Japan that promised expensive reparations. Upon learning about that, the queen contacted China and asked for their interference. As a result, Qing China gained more influence over the Korean peninsula

This upset the radicals (Party C). In 1884, [Kim Ok-gyun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ok-gyun), a 20-something pro-Japan radical, made [Gapsin Coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gapsin_Coup) with [Park Young-hyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Yung-hyo) and [Seo Jae-pil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soh_Jaipil) (all 20 years old) in order to replicate the Meiji Restoration in Korea, with the aid of the Japanese guards stationed in Korea. The coup only lasted for 3 days, often known as ""Three Days' Reign""

* This was quickly suppressed by a Chinese garrison stationed in Korea. This enhanced the Chinese influence over Korea until 1894
* After the failure of the coup, the coup leaders fled to Japan; *Seo Jae-pil* later went to the US, studied medicine, and became the ""first Korean American."" He married an American woman.
* While negotiating with Japan and China, **the queen persuaded the Chinese envoys to keep 2,000 soldiers disguised as Joseon police without Japan knowing it**. A famous Chinese general (later warlord) [Yuan Shikai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shikai) stayed in Korea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**(3) 10 years of peace - diplomatic balance and reforms**

Between the time period 1882\~1894, **the queen (and king) consistently pursued the policy of checking Japan's rising influence by allying with Qing China and Westerners**. Joseon signed a [treaty with the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon%E2%80%93United_States_Treaty_of_1882), [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1883), [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1883), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1884), and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France%E2%80%93Korea_Treaty_of_1886).

* She chose that direction because
   * (a) she knew that Japan posed the greatest national security threat to Korea - other nations (China and Westerners) were less interested in Korea's territory
   * (b) perhaps she did not agree with Japan's radical modernization and constitutional monarchy model. At the end of the day, she was a member of monarchy, and had a class interest in preserving its power

Many important changes were happening. I will just mention a few:

**Economic opening and reform**

* opening ports and collecting tariff from foreign trades
* **establishment of first Korean corporations**
* laying telegraph lines with China and Japan
* the issue of new coinage (which unfortunately caused an inflation)

**Medicine**:

* an [American doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Newton_Allen) treated a severe wound of one of the queen's relatives. A rumor spread that ""a foreigner with bushy red beard revived a dead noble."" Later the queen and king endorsed the establishment of **the** [**first Western hospital**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chejungwon) **and medical school** in Seoul. (a further[ story](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2022/03/177_285903.html))
   * [Another story about smallpox vaccine](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2022/10/715_309581.html)

**Education and culture**:

* The queen invited many **Western (American) missionaries to establish schools**.
   * The queen herself was never a Christian, and throughout her life, she followed a syncretism of Buddhism, Shamanism, and Confucianism like any other Joseon woman back then
   * But she knew the practical importance of Western knowledge, mathematics and science
* The queen also gave her patronage to the **first all-girls' educational institution**, Ewha Academy (now prestitious [Ewha Women's University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewha_Womans_University)).
   * The queen befriended several female American missionaries. The American women left many detailed, valuable records about the queen, undistorted by gender bias
* First modern newspapers were published
* Music: Christian hymns, chords, and instruments were introduced via missionaries and churches. Many of the first-generation Korean (modern) composers came from Christian families. They composed Korean anthems, children's songs, and national songs that are still taught in Korea

**Continuing military reform**:

* US generals were invited to Korea to provide advice and training
* Joseon court also established a new [navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Imperial_Naval_Academy)

&#x200B;

# 21. Peasant rebellion, the queen's anti-Japan stance, and the 45-year-old queen's violent murder by the Japanese [1894-1895]

**The opening and reform was not popular** outside of Seoul, among the less educated populace. **The vast populace in the provinces was deeply suspicious of anything foreign**, and rejected the new ideas of market economy and diplomacy.

In 1894, [a large-scale peasant rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donghak_Peasant_Revolution) took place, triggered by a local magistrate's abuse of power (*Gobu* magistrate *Cho Byeong-gap*) in the historically stigmatized Southwestern province Jeolla. This got magnified by a new religious movement called [Donghak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donghak) (""Eastern learning"" as opposed to ""Western learning"" aka Christianity). It was similar to China's [Taiping Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion)

* *Donghak* was a syncretism of some Christian creeds (equality between people) and Buddhism and shamanism. Its descendant cults and beliefs are still alive in Korea
   * My post ""[Korean indigenous new religious movements' holy sites in North Jeolla](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/xakco4/korean_indigenous_cults_holy_sites_in_north_jeolla/)""

The *Donghak* rebels had three initial demands:

* (1) Stop the ban on *Donghak*
* (2) **Expel Westerners, Expel Japan**
* (3) Kill corrupt court officials and magistrates

Some 80,000 believers gathered under the flags of ""Expel Westerners, Expel Japan"" (*Cheokyang Cheokwae*). Later it developed more radical slogans such as ""Kill all the Min clan members.""

* They **attached warning signs ""LEAVE"" to American, French, British, and Japanese residences, and Christian churches and schools**
   * Ironically, many of their campaigns were influenced by Western ideas: equality, women's rights (particularly widow's rights to remarry), people's councils, abolition of slavery, etc.
* Peasants were deeply sympathetic with them, and secretly helped the rebel army. They informed the rebels about the local geography and weather (e.g. mist), and sabotaged the state army (e.g. filling water in their cannons)
* A rumor that ghosts (supernatural power) are helping the rebels spread among the state army.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

This event might indicate the weakness of the queen's regime in controlling domestic affairs and local corruption. While she was an excellent diplomat and strategist, there's less evidence that she was good at internal affairs.

However, I'd like to defend her given **the constraints of her time**. Noble women were normally kept in ""inner chambers,"" ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/wzqxuu/womens_oppression_in_joseon_era/)) and banned from coming out of their residence in daylight ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20060217083642/http://www.gkn-la.net/history_resources/queen_min_tmsimbirtseva_1996.htm)). The queen was deeply hidden within the walls of the palace, and **she had to be unseen**. All the official commands had to come through the king. There were few contact points between her and the vast ""real world"" populace out there. There was a limit in her capability to control the internal affairs, compared to what was available to male rulers.

Although consort kins are normally demonized in the Confucian social systems, there is no evidence that the queen and her clan was particularly corrupt. Her personal spending was very modest, and the clan was under her control. The most famous clan member [Min Young-hwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Young-hwan) devoted himself to reforming the country, and committed suicide when Korea lost sovereignty to Japan. 

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

As a reaction to the rebellion, the Joseon court organized a committee for the [first large-scale reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabo_Reform). Then a series of international events followed:

* **Both Qing China and Japan tried to aid Joseon to quell the peasant rebellion, to increase their influence** in the Korean peninsula
* There were both pro-China and pro-Japan factions in the Joseon court. The queen was pro-China (Party B), but there were lots of pro-Japan court officials (Party C)
* **Japan was expanding their influence over the pro-Japan faction in Joseon. They also funded a** [**military unit**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hullyeondae) in the capital of Joseon, which would help Japanese operations later on
* The first Sino-Japanese War [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First\_Sino-Japanese\_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sino-Japanese_War) occurred - and unexpectedly, **Japan won, China lost.**

&#x200B;

After watching China losing the war, **the queen swiftly moved to ally with Russia to counterbalance Japan**. Japan was practically the biggest national security threat to Joseon, and the Japanese officials were already discussing a [military expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seikanron) into Joseon. Her foreign policy was consistently about checking Japan's rising influence.

* In 1895, while inviting Russians to the court, **she ordered the disbandment of the Japan-funded military unit** ([Hullyeondae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hullyeondae)).

This was what rang the death knell for the queen.

&#x200B;

In October of 1895, dozens of Japanese swordsmen entered the Korean palace. The Japan-funded Korean military unit (that the queen had tried to disband) cooperated to open the gate. **The Japanese swordsmen violently slaughtered the 45-year-old queen with katanas, ""violated"" her dead body** (I'd rather not know what happened), **displayed her dead body to Russians in the court as a warning**, **and burned her body to ash in a forest**.

Even the most pro-Japan Western[ historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Keene)s describe the event as ""unspeakably barbaric.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 21. The shockwave of the queen's violent murder; a short-lived Korean Empire 

Did the queen and king love each other?

* It is hard to tell. They were primarily political partners, their fates being intertwined. The Confucian polygamy allowed (and encouraged) the king to sleep around with different women and have children with them, while the queen had to be strictly faithful to the man. Would any modern woman be able to stand it? It must be very difficult.
   * But they grew together. For the first 5 years in their marriage, they were just children forced to be together. As they grew into adulthood, they discovered the potential as political partners in each other, and also became conjugal partners in a real sense. They had children together, explored the frightening new world, and pursued opening and reform together. **While the king did not have the political astuteness and shrewdness of the queen, he was a kind and warm-hearted man, sometimes had his own opinions and discussed them with the queen based on mutual respect**.
* Right after the queen's murder, the king's father *Daewongun* (the expelled former regent) immediately, a bit pathetically, returned to the palace upon the news. **The father demanded that the king sign an edict to demote the murdered queen to a lower-rank consort.** **The king refused it with unusual decisiveness, saying: ""I would rather have my hands cut off.""**

&#x200B;

The king was deeply depressed after the murder, and spent months in his chamber doing nothing. Then, he suddenly left his palace with his crown prince son, and voluntarily exiled into the Russian legation. There, **he continued the queen's policy direction--alliance with Russia--, and started kicking out the pro-Japan faction**. He got rid of them from his new cabinet, and executed several high officials in the pro-Japan faction. He willingly continued the policy direction of his murdered wife.

* Soon his father died, but **the king did not even attend his father's funeral**, which was an extreme violation of the Confucian social norms.

&#x200B;

**The queen's death also shocked the nation, and strong anti-Japan sentiment rose**. In 1896, young [Kim Gu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Gu) (later one of the most important independence fighters) murdered a Japanese man, suspecting that he was one of the Japanese assassins. He wrote in his journal:

>Could he ... one of \[the killers\]? Even if he is not, a Japanese man with a disguise and a sword can do nothing but harm to my country and people. I will revenge for my queen by killing this Japanese man.

He got a death sentence, but he escaped the prison (such a badass) and later organized many guerilla organizations.

Responding to the queen's murder and also the widely unpopular ""[Short Hair Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabo_Reform#Third_reforms)"" , the [Righteous Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Righteous_army) was also organized by Confucian scholars and concerned commoners

&#x200B;

In 1897, **the king proclaimed** [**the Korean Empire**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Empire) as a symbol of independence from imperial powers, and was coronated in an [imperial altar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwangudan) that had been only allowed for Chinese emperors before. In a [series of reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangmu_Reform), his new cabinet legally abolished the class system, and kept collaborating with Westerners (Americans, British, missionaries, etc.) to build infrastructure. Street cars, electricity, and street lamps were introduced in the capital *Hanyang* (Seoul).

>Wham-O — the company known for classic toys like Frisbees, Superballs, Hacky Sacks and the Slip N’ Slide, apparently had a second division called WAMO.  
>  
>WAMO produced a variety of non-toy products, including crossbows and slingshots. On top of that, they made three single-shot .22 LR guns in the 1950s.

Wanting to check to see if that was actually true, I managed to stumble down a rabbit hole. There were tons of threads from the early 2000s that discussed the connection, but no one seemed to be able to prove they were related. Both companies listed addresses in the same city, and they both were shown to have produced products called Powermasters. Wham-O had a series of slingshots and crossbows, and WAMO had an extremely limited run (allegedly 1 year) of .22 caliber single-shot pistols.

Here's the example of what the pistol advertisement looked like: [https://imgur.com/a/MYGitAM](https://imgur.com/a/MYGitAM)

I also dug around old forum posts for people that could definitively prove the connection. Most of the old pages were dead, but one was available through Wayback Machine. It was a guy's old blog ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20080914100736/http://www.airgunwriter.com/blog/blog.html)) where he shows a scan of an advertisement found in 1956 Science & Mechanics magazine which contains both logos on one product.

The part that I find most humorous is that despite being advertised as ""the safest firearm on the market"", this gun was incredibly dangerous to the person *holding* it. The weapon was described as being ""safe - dependable - rugged"" even though it was shoddily made. To load it, you would lock the bolt back, place a round in the chamber, then guide the bolt forward. In doing so, you also cock the striker back. Once loaded, a spring prevented the bolt from opening again. This also meant that the gun couldn't be unloaded

The other two *glaring* issues were that the gun didn't have a safety mechanism, and the bolt had a huge issue with slamming forward without the trigger having been pulled. This meant it went off for no reason, including due to being jostled.

This gun was available via mail order for $19.95 (or $29.98 now), and is now a collectors item that [rarely sells](https://www.gunauction.com/buy/11727965) because it's too dangerous to use (along with supply issues). So yeah, the company that sold hugely popular toys like Frisbees, Hula Hoops, and Silly String, also sold one of the most dangerous pistols that was made available to consumers through the post.

Edit: A commenter pointed out the inflation calculator I used was incorrect. The pistol was $19.95 in 1956, which is $220.94 nowadays. Cheers for pointing this out!",1667552062.0,2022-11-04 08:54:22+00:00

199,"When it comes to Cold War history, what do you think of these amusing(and some what funny) historical anecdotes about JFK, Fidel Castro and Che Guevara and their interactions?",24,ylvv7z,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ylvv7z/when_it_comes_to_cold_war_history_what_do_you/,1,"When one things of JFK and his relationship with Che Guevara and Fidel Castro one thinks of it largely in terms of being Cold War enemies due to the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis. But they also in the context of the 60s shared certain similarities and interestingly enough there were some somewhat amusing moments between them. Which might sound unbelievable given the fact that we're talking about the Cold War here. These are just some statements they made about each other directly and indirectly that are somewhat amusing.

**JFK on Castro**

* Castro once was giving his typical speeches which were at once charismatic, energetic and bombastic at the same time. JFK is asking a female reporter who's met Castro about it and he states, paraphrasing 'Why does Castro always have to give these long speeches. And what do people see in them'. Then JFK says 'Who does he sleep with? I hear he doesn't even take off his boot'. Then JFK says 'Castro gives all of these long speeches but where are the dames?'. So essentially JFK thinks that Castro gives so many speeches that he forgets to take off his fatigues so he can sleep with someone.
* There's a couple of ironies. The first is that from what is known Castro himself was a major playboy......like Kennedy himself. It almost became a major issue for him in fact where the CIA actually weaponised it for an assassination attempt. Second.....Kennedy trying to analyse and understanding the charismatic appeal of a young revolutionary at the time is......well ironic.

**JFK on Che Guevara**

* JFK is looking through photos of his daughter Caroline while speaking to the same female reporter who he spoke to about Castro. He isn't looking at the reporter but at the photo album. While looking at the photo album he says 'So tell me about El Che'. The reporter has also met Che and in fact interviewed him. Basically to paraphrase the reporter she said 'Well Che is charming, charismatic, cool, pragmatic, intellectual and blunt....a little like Kennedy'. The reporter notes about this conversation that when she would talk to Kennedy, he'd ask about Che, and when she'd talked to Che, he's talk about Kennedy. She also said that if they weren't political opposites, they would hit it off.  When JFK heard these descriptions he allegedly said 'Something tells me you've got the hots for Che'. The reporter is kinda floored and she says ""do you not see the photos of me arguing with him?"". And JFK states 'Yes but as any good psychologist would tell you, opposites attract'.
* There is another occasion where JFK overhears that Che was somewhat fascinated by Jacqueline Kennedy his wife and actually said she was the one American he'd like to meet. JFK responded by saying 'Well he'll have to wait in line'. 

**Castro on JFK**

* These are largely Castro's reactions to Kennedy's assassination. In the lead up Castro is speaking with a French reporter Jean Daniel. He is acting as a liason between him and JFK because they are in negotiations about normalising relations. Jean Daniel states that Castro said '*He still has the possibility of becoming, in the eyes of history, the greatest President of the United States, the leader who may at last understand that there can be coexistence between capitalists and socialists, even in the Americas. He would then be an even greater President than Lincoln. I know, for example, that for Khrushchev, Kennedy is a man you can talk with. I have gotten this impression from all my conversations with Khrushchev. Other leaders have assured me that to attain this goal, we must first await his re-election. Personally, I consider him responsible for everything, but I will say this: he has come to understand many things over the past few months; and then too, in the last analysis, I’m convinced that anyone else would be worse.” Then Fidel had added with a broad and boyish grin: “If you see him again, you can tell him that I’m willing to declare Goldwater my friend if that will guarantee Kennedy’s re-election*!”'.
* When the assassination was taking place Castro's reaction was one where '*He came back, sat down, and repeated three times the words: “Es una mala noticia.” (“This is bad news.”) He remained silent for a moment, awaiting another call with further news. He remarked while we waited that there was an alarmingly sizable lunatic fringe in American society and that this deed could equally well have been the work of a madman or a terrorist. Perhaps a Vietnamese? Or a member of the Ku Klux Klan? The second call came through: it was hoped they would be able to announce that the United States President was still alive, that there was hope of saving him. Fidel Castro’s immediate reaction was: “If they can, he is already re-elected.” He pronounced these words with satisfaction*.'
* A somewhat amusing turn in a very morbid way was when the broadcasters were describing the details of the assassination, '*One reporter felt he should mention the difficulty Mrs. Kennedy was having in getting rid of her bloodstained stockings. Fidel exploded: “What sort of a mind is this!” He repeated the remark several times: “What sort of a mind is this? There is a difference in our civilizations after all. Are you like this in Europe? For us Latin Americans, death is a sacred matter; not only does it mark the close of hostilities, but it also imposes decency, dignity, respect. There are even street urchins who behave like kings in the face of death. Incidentally, this reminds me of something else: if you write all those things I told you yesterday against Kennedy’s policy, don’t use his name now; speak instead of the policy of the United States government*.”'.

**Che on JFK**

* The closest interact Che had with Kennedy was indirectly through JFK's aide Richard Goodwin. Its at a major conference of the Americas in Uruguay in August of 1961. The Bay of Pigs happened months before. JFK's personal aide along with the Secretary of the Treasury to Uruguay had travelled their to announce what was called the Alliance for Progress. In this conference Che gives a blistering speech denouncing the Alliance for Progress. However behind the scenes Che actually seeks out Richard Goodwin, JFK's personal aide. 
* Che challenges Goodwin to a smoking competition when seeing him smoking a cigar by daring him to smoke a Cuban. Goodwin takes it up. During this meeting they had a relaxed atmosphere with Goodwin allegedly not wanting him to ""out proleterianise"" him and so they sat casually on the ground with each other. In the process Che says the famous lines ""Thank you for the Bay of Pigs, before it the revolution was tenuous, now it is stronger than ever"". Goodwin of course responds ""You're welcome, now perhaps you might invade Guatanomo"". Che of course just smiles and says never. Che then states that he actually did see the Kennedy era people as a new generation that actually wanted change but that the reforms he was proposing was too late. Then Che fascinatingly goes on to describe Cuba's problems bluntly, including what he saw as the failures of his own monetary policy(knowing full well this is JFK's personal aide). Che then gives Goodwin a gift of Cuban cigars meant for JFK from Castro with a personal message to Kennedy. Famously Kennedy sees the gift and just asks ""are they good""? 

Its just fascinating that they had these somewhat ""amusing"" interactions(though indirect) while being involved in some of the most intense clashes as Cold War enemies.",1667559815.0,2022-11-04 11:03:35+00:00

Not all of them were named ‘Alexandria’ but quite a few were. Today very few of them exist, and some we don’t even know the exact location of. However a handful have become major metropolitan areas. The Alexandrias we know the exact locations of are:

- Alexandria (the most famous one and the second largest city in Egypt)
- Alexandria on the Latmus (Alinda, now present day Karpuzlu, Turkey)
- Alexandria on the Bay of Issus (Iskanderun, Turkey. Previously known as Alexandretta)
- Alexandria in Mygdonia (Erbil, Iraq. It is unknown if Alexander founded a new city close to Arbela (Irbil) or simply renamed the existing city. Very close to where the Battle of Gaugamela took place).
- Alexandria in Susiana (Now abandoned, near Maysar, Iraq. Was also called Antiochia in Susiana and Charax Spasinu.)
- Alexandria in Carmania (Location unknown but highly likely it was located near the village of Gulashkird, Iran, now present-day Faryab)
- Alexandria in Aria (Herat, Afghanistan)
- Alexandria Prophthasia (Farah, Afghanistan)
- Alexandria in Arachosia (Kandahar, Afghanistan)
- Alexandria Opiana (Ghazni, Afghanistan)
- Alexandria in the Caucasus (Bagram, Afghanistan)
- Alexandria in Margiana (Merv, Turkmenistan, now destroyed)
- Alexandria Tharmata (Not known if this was the exact name. Located by present day Termez, Uzbekistan)
- Alexandria Eschate (Khojand, Tajikistan)
- Alexandria Bucephalia (Jhelum, Pakistan. Named after Alexander’s horse Bucephalus)
- Alexandria Hyphasis (Near Amritsar, India)
- Alexandria on the Indus (Uch, Pakistan)
- Port of Alexander/Alexandrou Limen/Xylinepolis (near Karachi, Pakistan)
- Alexandria in Rhambacia (Near modern day Bela, Pakistan)

In addition, Alexander also founded these cities which were not named after him:

- Nicaea in Afghanistan, located near the city of Jalalabad, Afghanistan 
- Gaza, Palestine. Whether he founded it or destroyed an existing settlement and rebuilt it is disputed. Gaza is the Greek name for the city.
- Arigaeum, exact location unknown but it was in northern Afghanistan 
- Nicephorium (Although some historians believe this city was founded by Seleucus). Present day Raqqa, Syria.
- Patala, located near present day Thatta, Pakistan.

Other potential cities that we don’t know the exact location of:

- Alexandria on the Pallakopas, potentially near Najaf, Iraq
- Alexandria Soriana (Maybe Shorkot, Pakistan) but the existence of the city is disputed
- Nicaea in India, located close to Alexandria Bucephalus. 
- Alexandria of the Sogdoi, located on the Indus River in Pakistan
- Alexandria on the Acesines (located near the modern Chenab river in Pakistan)
- Alexandria on the Oxus. Location unknown, but identified as either Ai-Khanoum in Afghanistan or Kampir Tepe in Uzbekistan 
- Alexandria in Sacastene, potentially near Zaranj, Afghanistan although this may also just be Alexandria Prophthasia
- Alexandropolis Maedica, unknown location in present day Bulgaria
- Alexandropolis in Parthia, potentially another name for the Parthian capital of Nisa in Turkmenistan but this is disputed 
- Alexandria near Bactra, close to Balkh, Afghanistan. May have been Alexandria Tharmata or Alexandria on the Oxus.

Slaves were also not allowed to leave the households of their masters without permission as well.

All this hints that Qing society (and I assume other dynasties as well) had some form of chattel slavery system going on. Was it on the same scope as slavery in colonial Americas?

205,"When it comes to Cuba's military victory at the Bay of Pigs, does Che Guevara deserve any credit or should it be assigned exclusively to Castro's leadership?",816,yk1r0q,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/yk1r0q/when_it_comes_to_cubas_military_victory_at_the/,188,"In the Bay of Pigs affair we know of course that a major reason why the operation failed was because Kennedy refused to through with the plan fully. Known as Operation Zapata it had two parts. The first part being to train the exiles to invade. The second being that the Marines would go in if part 1 failed. JFK refused to go through with part 2 and allowed the invasion to fail.

However major part of why Cuba won was of course because of their preparations for the operation. Now when it comes to Castro himself he of course was the leader of the country. And during the Bay of Pigs he personally commanded the Cuban army going on the battlefield himself. Che by contrast was not involved in the fighting as his forces were diverted from the battlefield by a fake mock invasion the Marines stage to split the Cuban forces.

However in the lead up to the Bay of Pigs Che Guevara was assigned by Castro in the training of Cuba's forces as director of instruction for Cuba's armed forces. He was largely responsible for helping to form the armed forces of the new revolutionary government at the time as well as the creation of the National Revolutionary Militia, a citizens militia, that played a key role in repelling the invasion. Che along with Fabian Escalante was also important in the formation of Cuba's intelligence services. Cuba's intelligence services were of course the ones who discovered the Bay of Pigs plan.

So essentially he didn't command the operations or participate in the fighting. That was Castro. But he formed, trained, and disciplined the army and militias that went out to fight in the Bay of Pigs. So from a Cuban political perspective would he get any credit for their victory at the Bay of Pigs or would it still go mostly to Castro?",1667385604.0,2022-11-02 10:40:04+00:00

Yet, I'm left wondering if there were people in the United States, or the Federal Government, would have some involvement in the conflict? I'm guessing that there would be some sentiment of the United States to support the revolutionaries? Perhaps a few societies that supported the Patriots down south? 

Since they're mirroring their own revolution decades prior, so there would be at least some people in the States to actively favor to support the Patriot down South? Perhaps a movement to call for intervention? Then I also wonder what was the relationship and opinions of the United States  on the Spanish American Revolutionary leaders, and vice versa. Like, did Simon Bolivar reach to the United States for support in the war? I'd wager that they would see some sort of similarity due to fighting an Independence War, and aid would be sent.

I was researching for a documentary series Ive been releasing on youtube called ""Finding Lola"" ( I won't link so this post isn't removed for spam)--where Im working through the history of white-passing in my family and the circumstances around that in both Louisiana and NY.  To be honest, I started the project angry at my Gram Lola for lying to the whole family about our heritage, but now I feel....shocked. Sad for her and how much she tried to protect the whole family the best she could. The article notes that the ""one drop rule"" (1/32 African) was still in effect until 1983.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

229,"Question: Japanese History, Edo Period foccused - What are the different ranks of Yujo? (Japanese Prostitutes)",7,ygr5ak,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/ygr5ak/question_japanese_history_edo_period_foccused/,1,"Hi! I've been googling this for the past couple hours and the amount of conflicting information is astounding. I'd really appreciate some help figuring this out, as well as the actual differences between the ranks.

Here's my current list (...of lists, because of the lack of consistency) of Yujo ranks from highest to lowest. Please let me know if I am close. Seems like the ranks evolved with time, so perhaps my issue is information regarding different time periods. There's also the use of Oiran, which seems to be a catch-all term for high rank Yujo, perhaps applied belatedly, or maybe not. And there's also the comon misconception that Geisha were prostitutes (which is debatable, ""they weren't supposed to be"" seems to be the realistic answer,) further muddying the waters.

&#x200B;

List 1: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oiran#Ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oiran#Ranks) Wikipedia, the most illustrious of sources.

1. Tayū - The Highest Rank and very rare. Didn't sell sexual services. Didn't sit in the Harimise for viewing by the public either. Had Kamuro, these young female servants. They had to be contacted indirectly through other people. ""Oiran"" seems to fit this rank too.
2. Kōshi - no idea
3. Yobidashi Tsukemawarashi - Yobidashi means ""by appointment only."" They did'nt sit  in Harimise. As for Tsukemawarashi, it's apparently mid-level, but no  explaination why.
4. Sancha - no idea
5. Tsukemawarashi - no idea
6. Zashikimochi - unsure about this. Elsewhere said they had their own room and Kamuro and which puts seem to put them higher up the ranks...but here they are at the bottom. No idea why.

&#x200B;

List 2: [https://ceas.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Yokoyama%202016.pdf](https://ceas.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Yokoyama%202016.pdf)

From this PDF, table 8.1 showing the ranks, prices and population for each rank. I added Tayu despite the table not showing any.

1. Tayu - ""  ""
2. Koshi - Still no idea
3. Tsubone -  Apparently used to be a high rank, but became devalued to the point of working in ""cubicles"". The diagram in the PDF looks like pretty bad conditions, but not a cubicle.
4. Sancha - No idea what makes them better than Jijoro.

.Chusan - A high rank Sancha

.Umecha - A low rank Sancha

5. Jijoro - ditto

&#x200B;

These are the 2 most consistent ranking systems I've found, with others adding or retracting various ranks, such as a Heya-Mochi who was lower than Zashiki-Moshi, but had her own room, Kashi Joro who are suspiciously similarly named to Koshi and placed at the bottom. Found those here: [https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yujo%20(prostitute).html](https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yujo%20(prostitute).html) and here [https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Oiran.html](https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Oiran.html)

There were others, where I frankensteined most of the reasoning behind the ranks from, but I can't find them anymore. Sorry.

I hope I provided enough information for everyone to go through.

# Phase 4. Deepening Confucian Orthodoxy, Isolationism, and Underground Spread of Catholicism [1640s~1860s]

Contemporary Koreans often ask ""Why was Joseon not able to modernize itself like Japan did?"" Then the answers tend to blame a particular political figure, like *Heungson Dawongun* in the 19th century.

However, many also view it as **a systematic failure of neo-Confucianism as a political ideology**.

* As I said, **neo-Confucianism basically idealized the social norms of the ancient Chinese bronze age**, based on what was written in 2,500-year-old scripts
   * It was indeed effective in preserving the stability of an agrarian society, and preserving the social hierarchy (landed aristocracy)
* **Joseon became a radically neo-Confucian society in the 15th century, resulting in the lack of merchant and military class** that would have been naturally open to the Western/modern ideas (in contrast, there was a strong merchant and military class in Edo Japan)

Well, to be fair, as long as the imperial China stayed in power, Joseon's model could still work. Joseon would have stayed their **most loyal vassal state**, and the imperial China would have protected Joseon, so that Joseon would remain as an isolated, agrarian hermit kingdom**.**

* That was Joseon's state model called *Sadae*. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadae))
* **North Korea's Juche (self-reliance!) is a reaction** to this *Sadae. Juche* is an interesting successor of Joseon's neo-Confucianism - ***Juche*** **radically refuses the influence of any foreign empires, but its social ideal is still a ""pure,"" agrarian, self-sufficient society** not so different from what was idealized by old Confucianists. 

And the model worked again in the Japan invasion - Ming China eventually helped Joseon, and the kingdom of Joseon survived even though its population and economy got devastated (the main [royal palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongbokgung) got destroyed and didn't get restored for 250 years) **The royal family and the landed aristocracy survived and continued their old way**. **No travel, no trades, no foreign ideas**. And it worked for the following 200 years.

# 13. Diplomats and princes bring Western science and Christianity from China; The Crown Prince is poisoned to death by his father for that

* Since the 16th century (1500s), China and Japan were exposed to Western science and Christianity by Portuguese/Italian/Dutch missionaries and merchants, but Korea was not
   * No Catholic missionaries visited Korea yet. Christianity (Catholicism) was first introduced into Korea by Korean diplomats and princes returning from China
   * It is allegedly a diplomat named [Yi Su-gwang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Su-gwang) who first introduced Christian books (written in Chinese) into Korea. He also wrote a giant [encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibong_yuseol) \- he was critical of the scholarly class in Joseon, and said "" there are too many sajok (scholarly class), idlers, vagrants and too few people liable for (military) service""
* The [Crown Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prince_Sohyeon) of Joseon was a captive in Qing China for 9 years, and returned to Korea with new ideas - Western science and Christianity. His father, the king who was humiliated by Manchu, hated this and was suspicious of the Crown Prince. Soon after, **the prince was found dead in his chamber, with the signs of poisoning**
   * The king sent three sons of the killed crown prince into exile, and never visited the crown prince's tomb

\*\* Around this time, **the first westerners were drifted to the Korean peninsula in shipwrecks**. The first Westerner was probably this [Dutch guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Jansz_Weltevree) who got Korean name *Park Yeon* and settled with his Korean wife. He worked as a government official, and was not allowed to leave Korea.

* Then another group of Dutchmen, [Hamel and his crew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Hamel) were drifted to the island of Jeju from Japan (Jeju is an island that has a distinct history and its own [Koreanic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_language)). It is said that when *Park Yeon* saw his fellow Dutchmen after like 20 years, he cried a lot. Hamel and his crew were sent to Seoul, and were sent around to different towns, until they eventually escaped to Japan after 13 years. Hamel was invited to many aristocrats' houses (for their curiosity), and **later Hamel's observation of the ""hermit kingdom"" was published** in Netherlands ([link](https://www.hendrick-hamel.henny-savenije.pe.kr/home.htm))
* I didn't read his manuscript myself, but according to this [article](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2020/07/137_169998.html), he mentioned **while Japan traded far and away, there were no foreign ships in Korea** other than a few Chinese and Japanese ones. Plus, it seems that he complained about having to eat rice only with salt and water...
   * However, later Japanese envoys to the US made an opposite complaint. When the Japanese asked for rice, the Americans gave them rice with sugar. The Japanese were so shocked by that

&#x200B;

# 14. Orthodox faction fighting, consort Jang Hui-bin's curse

The royal family and landed aristocracy maintained their old way. Around this time Confucian political factions would be called ""*bungdang*."" In early Joseon, the factions fought over matters of practical importance - such as land distribution. However, in late-Joseon, the faction fighting came to be centered around **the literal application of ancient Chinese family rites, and legitimacy disputes**.

\*\* Typically, a faction fighting would go this way

* A faction disapproves the legitimacy of the incumbent king (e.g. ""he's born from a concubine or a court maiden""; ""he shouldn't have acted hat way, that was against the Confucian norm)
   * As people suggested in the previous post, the plot of Kingdom on Netflix is based on this
* Or, a faction accuses another faction that they're traitors and they're secretly trying to enthrone another prince (often a half-brother)
* => triggers the insecurity of the incumbent king
* => purges/kills/expels the accused prince and all members of an affiliated faction (often their families and relatives, too)
* => Now the winning faction becomes dominant in court. **Then they split again over the most insignificant, petty issue that they can't agree upon**
* => Repeat

The most amazing example of this, well-known to Koreans, was decades of faction fighting over **whether a deceased king's young stepmother should wear a funeral robe for three-years, or one-year.** This debate led to another faction fighting, then another faction fighting.

This crazy court in-fighting was entangled with **three generations of royal family drama**. Fortunately, someone else had written an incredibly rich account of the timeline of the faction fighting on Reddit, so I will add a link here.

[Check this!](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2sg2tf/this_is_literally_the_worst_thing_i_have_ever/)

I think this comment succinctly summarized the situation

>It's like **the equivalent of Keynesian and neo-liberal economists regularly accusing each other of treasonous conspiracies, burning each others books, and convincing the government to murder each other**.

This [**link**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northerners_(Korean_political_faction)) also shows a nice overview of the crazy complex genealogy of late-Joseon factions.

&#x200B;

\*\*\[\*\*Notable event: **Consort Jang Hui-bin (*****Joseon*****'s Ann Boleyn?) and her shamanic curse\]**

* This is the most dramatized event during this period
* King [Sukjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukjong_of_Joseon) actively engaged in faction fighting, changing dominant factions (by bloody purges) depending on his mood
   * When his **beloved concubine** [**Jang Hui-bin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Noble_Consort_Huibin_Jang) **gave birth to a son**, he was ecstatic and tried to name the boy an heir apparent. The dominant faction opposed to it because she's a concubine, and **the king got infuriated and purged (tortured, killed, beheaded, sent in exile) the dominant faction members**. Hui-bin got promoted to the rank of queen, and the existing queen got demoted.
   * Then the king took another concubine, and some complex court infighting unfolded. The new concubine gave birth to another son. The original queen got reinstated. **The king's love interest changed**, and he gave less attention to Jang and her son. He betrayed her and her affiliated faction
   * For the following 5 years, **Jang Hui-bin used shamanistic ritual to curse the reinstated queen. Some scary witchcraft. The queen indeed died.**
      * I heard that the voodoo dolls were excavated until quite recently around royal places in Seoul
   * Eventually, **Jang Hui-bin got executed by the order of her husband. Poison bowl**. Gone.
      * She's one of the most dramatized figures in k period drama, although she might not be well-known to the outside world
   * However, after her death, her son became the next king. Another large-scale purge ensued. The new king died early, though.

\*\* it is interesting how much the fate of a political faction depended on whether a particular queen from their faction (clans) produced a male heir or not. I find that this was a typical issue not just in Joseon, but also throughout the Chinese history within the Confucian patrilineal/polygamy system

* **A queen's fate utterly depended upon whether she gives birth to a son or not**. And infant mortality rate was extremely high in this era. In the pre-modern time women had no control over that, so **these women desperately relied on all types of superstitions**

&#x200B;

# 15. Yeongjo successfully reigns; his Crown Prince Sado develops psychosis, and gets publicly executed by his father

[Yeongjo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeongjo_of_Joseon) is enthroned in 1724, and leads Joseon's relatively stable 18th century. His mother was a concubine of low birth, so it is commonly said that he always had huge status anxiety about that

He had an acute political talent and charisma, and minimized the faction fighting under his policy called ""Grand Harmony"" (*tangpyeong*). He established ""universal"" and fair military service tax, and [sent secret royal inspector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_royal_inspector)s to provinces to inspect corruptions at the local level. [Park Mun-su](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Mun-su) is a legendary secret royal inspector, and any Korean person would recognize the phrase ""Secret royal inspector here!"" (*Amhaeng-eosa chuldu-yo*)

Under the stability, the economy revived and Seoul became the little center of commerce

* However, it should be noted that Joseon Korea still did not engage in any large-scale international trades. Commerce was still at a primitive level, compared to Japan and China. Joseon was a **deeply conservative isolationist hermit kingdom**, and its capital was smaller and poorer than Edo (Tokyo's old name) or Beijing. Plus, Japan and China might have actively obstructed Joseon from developing its own trading network
   * \* Korean history textbooks commonly say that ""early capitalism was budding” but I'm not sure how true this was. Joseon still had a strictly isolationist, agriculture-based economy
* That said, aristocrats in Seoul enjoyed imports from Qing China, and ""Qing style"" material goods became popular.

Despite his achievement, unfortunately Yeongjo is most famous for **the dramatic public execution of his mentally ill son,** Crown Prince Sado. The Crown Prince started showing signs of violence and mental illness at the age of 22. He killed eunuchs and maidens, walked around the palace with their severed heads, and corpses and injured people had to be carried from the palace every day. He had paranoia about his father's scolding, thunders, and bizarrely, dressing. He started using immense amount of clothing to get dressed, because if something went slightly wrong in the dressing process, he would freak out and start the process all over again. When servants made a slight error, he hurt them or even killed them.

* His symptoms are well-described in the diaries of his wife (written in the Korean script) - [Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_Lady_Hyegyeong). Her descriptions are very detailed, and she made her own theories of why he came to be that way. It's perhaps because of his upbringing, his father's constant scolding and extremely high expectation, and/or the curse of Jang Hui-bin (Sado grew up in the pavilion where Jang had resided). She said otherwise he was a decent and handsome man. **Modern scholars suggest that he might have had schizophrenia**
* The father fiercely hated his son, and never forgave his weaknesses. Ultimately, on a hot July day, **the king ordered the mad crown prince to climb into a wooden rice chest in the middle of the court. After screaming for his father's mercy for eight days, the prince died**. The Crown Prince Sado is one of the two examples of madness in the Joseon royal family, with the other being *Yeonsan* (section 6)
* There's a recent film about it that was popular among Koreans [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Throne\_(film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Throne_(film)) (2015)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 16. The rise of Pragmatist School (Silhak) and Catholicism

* ""Pragmatist School"" is my translation because no one reading this would remember the word *Silhak*... there was a small yet growing number of Confucian scholars who deviated from and **criticized the dogmatism** of Joseon neo-Confucianism.
   * Starting from a diplomat Yi Su-gwang's [encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibong_yuseol) work, the school slowly grew during the 17th and 18th century. The scholars who belonged to this school **commonly traveled Qing China, and saw how the Qing economy benefited from commerce and Western knowledge**
   * Many of the pragmatists still focused on land reform -- a traditional, Confucian way of addressing economic issues. However, there were more radical thinkers who thought that Joseon needed to break out of isolation and engage more in international trades. [Park Ji-won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bak_Jiwon_(born_1737)), a satirical writer, was one of them. His travelogue [The Jehol Diary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jehol_Diary) extensively discussed the topic
   * [A scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Deuk-gong) was influenced by Qing's evidence-based historiography (which was again influenced by Western science), and identified forgotten histories of the Korean peninsula (*Balhae)*
   * A [scientific minded scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Daeyong) was deeply impressed by the Copernican theory
      * There's a folklore that when he talked about his theory (""the earth revolves around the sun!""), other Confucian scholars just said ""huh huh that's interesting"" and paid no attention to it
   * They were mostly **underdogs and outsiders** of the scholar-aristocrat class, mainly based in the capital Seoul. For example, [Yi Ik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Ik_(born_1681)) **saw his brother beaten to death involved in the Consort Jang's witchcraft scandal** (section 14), and lost interest in court politics
   * However, the school grew substantially by the late 18th century, and some of them would be hired by the king Jeongjo (will be explained later)

&#x200B;

* Famously, **Korea is the only country where Christianity (Catholicism) spread by locals indigenously** without the presence of Western missionaries. Catholicism was first introduced by a Korean diplomat returning from Qing China in the 17th century. **He brought a bible translated in classical Chinese**. It was understood as part of ""Western knowledge."" Knowledge about the Christian teachings slowly spread among dissasified scholar-aristocrats and merchants in Seoul and Northern provinces (Pyongyang).
   * About 100 years later, **still without the presence of any Western missionaries, the first Catholic prayer-house was founded in 1784 in Seoul** by [Yi Seung-hun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Seung-hun), a diplomat who had been baptized in Beijing. He brought Christian books, crucifixes, and other Catholic artifacts to Korea.
   * By the time when an ordained Chinese priest arrived Korea in 1795, **the underground Church had grown to over 4000 members**, with many of them being nobles and aristocrats.

# 17. The mad crown prince Sado's son, Jeongjo, is enthroned. He hires the Pragmatists and partially explores Western knowledge

* Despite his father's madness and tragic death (section 14-3), [Jeongjo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeongjo_of_Joseon) grew up to be a smart boy and became the next king.
* He's remembered as the most progressive king in *Joseon* history, and still beloved and lamented by many Koreans. He:
   * **hired the Pragmatist school scholars**, mostly notably [Jeong Yak-yong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Yak-yong)
      * Jeong famously built the [Hwaseong Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwaseong_Fortress) using **Western technologies**
      * Many pragmatist school scholars were also **affiliated with Catholicism -** [**Jeong's brother**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Yak-jong) **was central to the Catholic community in Seoul**, and he translated catechism in the Korean script to spread the beliefs to more people. He would be martyred in the persecution that would follow the death of Jeongjo
      * Jeong himself had denounced Catholicism, because he was deep down a Confucian scholar and was repelled by the Catholics' refusal to do ancestor spirit rituals. This would save his life later.
      * During the first Catholic persecution (1801), Jeong was spared his life and sent into exile - famously in a Southwestern county *Gangjin*. He would spend 18 years of his life in exile. He was extremely prolific there and wrote 500 volumes and 14,000 pages of books - on classics, politics, ethics, economy, natural sciences, medicine, music, and even fishery. **His book on the ethics of governors**, *Mokminsimseo*, is still popular and read by modern Koreans
      * However, he was confined by the constraints of his time - some of his arguments were still deeply retro-oriented and Confucian. For example, he argued for **the restoration of** [**the well-field system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-field_system)**, an idealized land distribution principle that had existed in the 9th century BC China**, instead of promoting commerce and international trades
   * The king established a new royal library named [Gyujanggak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyujanggak) to promote knowledge (which still exists as part of the prestigious [Seoul National University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_National_University))
   * The king also **allowed for a free market in Seoul** (before that, only a few state-endorsed merchants could operate)

\*\* However, the king had a conservative side too, and banned ""new styles of writing"" in documents, only allowing classical Chinese style. He also banned the import of many Western books.

* He knew that he had many conservative enemies who opposed to his reforms. He **built a group of private royal bodyguards, and had his servants taste his food first to test for poisons**. An advisor named [Hong Guk-young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Guk-yeong) is known to have helped him a lot.
* However, despite all the efforts, **he was found dead mysteriously** at the age of 47. He was previously healthy, so many people suspected poisoning.

# 18. Andong Kim clan takes power and provides queens for three puppet kings; Rampant corruption destabilizes the society; China loses the Opium Wars

* Jeongjo died (or got assissinated) in 1800. His 10-year-old son got enthroned, and his grandmother (Jeongjo's stepmother) took power as the [queen dowager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Jeongsun). She was Jeongjo's stepmother who was only a few years older than him; she was 15 year old when she married 60-year-old Yeongjo
* She was a deeply conservative 50-year old woman, and her faction was against Catholicism. They **launched an all-out attack on Catholics** \- which was understood as a bizarre foreign cult, that refused to do ancestor spirit rituals, and thus denied the teachings of Confucian classics and the divinity of the royal family (in their cosmology, the royal ancestors are kind of at the top of the pantheon of the ancestors of clans)
   * In the [persescution of 1801](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Persecution_of_1801), several hundred core members of the Christian community in Seoul were executed, including many nobles
* Then power was transmitted to the young boy king's [father-in-law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jo-sun_(politician)), who was the leading figure of the queen dowager's faction. He married his daughter to the boy king
* Andong Kim clan means ""Kim clan originating from the town of Andong"" (many modern Koreans still belong to [such a clan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon-gwan)). Under the king's father-in-law's ladership, the clan took power, and took many important positions in the court
   * **Rampant corruption** ensued - the civil service exam degenerated, and exam takers started **bribing the clan members** for government/provincial positions. Those who bribed for their position became extremely exploitative of their land and peasants
   * Tax system also degenerated - the practice of ""taxing yellow mouth"" (taxing newborns) and ""taxing white skulls"" (taxing dead people) emerged. Overall, the **tax on peasant population became extremely high, which caused peasants to run away from their land and disappear** from the state registry. This exacerbated the tax burden on the remaining people
* The clan enthroned three puppet kings, and it is famous that the [last of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheoljong_of_Joseon) was a distant relative who was living as a poor peasant in an island.
   * Context: The puppet king's grandfather was a half-brother of King Jeongjo, but the family was **executed and sent in exile because his wife and daughter-in-law were Catholic.** The puppet king grew up as a poor peasant in an island with limited education. When the royal envoy appeared at his village, he was petrified. He did not have any real power in his reign.

&#x200B;

**\*\* China: The opium crisis and opium war**

* In this period, t[he opium crisis in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_opium_in_China) was started by the British East India Company (gosh, they were drug lords! The graph in the wiki article reminds me of Narcos so much) and China lost the historic Opium War.
* This would turn out to be the most important watershed moments in the East Asian history
   * Famously, after watching China losing the two Opium Wars, **a coup happened in Japan that would lead to a complete reform of the government and Westernization** ([Meiji Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration))
   * Why did Korea fail to do the same? Modern Koreans are still haunted by the question. However, realistically, I think it is important to note that Japan and Korea in the 19th century were **not on an equal footing**. Japan and Korea's path had been diverged since the time of Mongol invasion in the 13th century. Japan had been engaging in international trades ""far and away"" for hundreds of years, ranging from the Moluccas in Indonesia to the Sea of Okhotsk (far east Russia). Japan already had a relatively good understanding of Europe, European languages (mainly through [Dutch studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangaku)), and their institutions.
   * Korea was a completely **isolated society - it was a closed world**. Koreans had been **prohibited from leaving the country** except for a few diplomats. It was **not that different from modern-day North Korea**. International trades were extremely limited except for occasional trades with China and Japan at a designated place (Korea-Manchu border, and a small Japanese district in Busan).
   * As long as the Confucian cosmic order was alive, Koreans were content to live and die in their ancient homeland, living in their old ways inspired by the ancient classics. However, things were falling apart, and Koreans were only slowly making sense of what was going on around their small world.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign ships appear**
   * By this time, more foreign forces started visiting Qing China - from the UK, France, US, Russia, etc - and they **frequented the Korean shore** as well. Some of them sacked Korean coastal cities. Famously, some French sailors dug up ancient Korean royal tombs
   * Isolationist Joseon Korea just reacted by shooting the ships with cannons
* **An apocalyptic sentiment** emerged nationwide
   * Major social unrest was unfolding. A [major rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Gyeong-Rae) occurred in a Northern province around Pyongyang.
      * The ancient city of Pyongyang was always a bit rebellious in the late-Joseon era, and it was becoming the Christian center of the nation at this point
* [**Andrew Kim Taegon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kim_Taegon) **became the first ordained Korean Catholic priest**. I remember his story that he crossed the Korea-China ice-covered river border on foot in an extremely cold weather, and walked all the way down to Macau (near Hong Kong) to attend a seminary there. Back in Joseon Korea, he preached, got arrested, and executed at the age of 25 with thousands of other Catholics.
   * It is said that the spectators were impressed by his poise and serenity at his execution. They asked ""What about the faith made him like that?"" His last word was:

>This is my last hour of life, listen to me attentively: if I have held communication with foreigners, it has been for my religion and my God. It is for Him that I die. My immortal life is on the point of beginning. Become Christians if you wish to be happy after death, because God has eternal chastisements in store for those who have refused to know Him

* **About 10,000 Korean Catholics were killed in this period.** [**103 of them**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Martyrs) **were canonized as martyrs** by the Catholic church later 
* However, Catholicism was still a fringe foreign belief - it was called ""Western learning,"" and many Koreans were deeply suspicious of that. Soon, an **indigenous new religious movement called ""**[**Eastern Learning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donghak)**""** would catalyze a large-scale peasant rebellion that swept the Southern part of Korea.

&#x200B;

Some minor 19th century figures:

\*\* [Kim Satgat](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2012/11/162_92963.html) (""Kim the Hat"") was a legendary bard/minstrel who wandered around the peninsula

\*\* [Bongi Kim Seondal](https://folkency.nfm.go.kr/en/topic/detail/5454): A legendary swindler/con man from Pyongyang who famously sold free water to people from [Daedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taedong_River) River

\*\* ""Chusa"" [Kim Jeong-hui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gim_Jeong-hui): a calligrapher and pragmatist scholar famous for his very distinct calligraphy style

&#x200B;

An interesting fact:

* According to [a scholar](https://koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2019/11/739_261434.html), Korea probably had the greatest concentration of genealogical publications (Jokbo) of any country. Jokbos in early Joseon era included the names of women and female descendants, but in the late Joseon era, it would be **exclusively about male lines (patrilinearity)**.
* When the social system started collapsing in the late-Joseon era, Jokbo was also bought and sold. **A large number of peasants who were wealthy enough bought Jokbo from fallen scholar-aristocrats**, and claimed ancestry to nobles and kings. ([link](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/world/in-s-korea-a-town-of-kims-and-an-unusual-shared-history/)) So even though a Korean person you know has an extensive family genealogy book, there's a good chance that it was bought multiple generations ago.

Colonial sources provide some data about the way in which the Huetars fought. One of the most complete accounts of these practices is offered by the aforementioned Jerónimo Benzoni, when he describes the struggle of the indians of Suerre, who were joined by the Huetares of Tayutic to destroy the group of Spaniards led by Governor Diego Gutiérrez in 1544:

""with frightful cries and noise, making a racket with horns and drums, all painted red and black, with plumage and gold jewelry around their necks and other trappings, as is customary in all these nations of the Indies when they go to war... We were soon killed with rocks and batons, and run through with spears made of palm wood... We passed through more than twenty-five Indians, and they were all lords, who each carried only one spear in their hand and a cloak thrown over one shoulder, and they had no paint like the others… we found out that they had cut off and taken the head, feet, and hands of the Governor \[Diego Gutiérrez\], as well as of two black men, and all the others had been stripped down and thrown into a stream, and that everything had been taken except the oil and the soap"". (In L. Fernandez 1889, 89-90).

The following observations are inferred from the previous text:

1. shouting and musical instruments (wind and percussion) accompanied the fighters,

2. they got painted and decorated (according to Benzoni, it was general),

3. they used rocks, batons and spears as offensive weapons,

4. a hierarchical boss-soldier order was established, marked by external behaviors,

5. the winners cut off the head and other members of the body as a trophy (see details on page 65).

In 1563, the chieftain of Tayutic communicated to Juan Vázquez de Coronado that the chieftain of Suerre «has the clothes and weapons of Diego Gutiérrez and of his people» (Vázquez de Coronado 1964, 61), so that not only did they cut limbs, but that they also took precious objects. In this particular case, the weapons of the Spaniards must have caused some kind of admiration among the indians of Suerre, since they took them and kept them for almost twenty years. But the Huetares also did the same with the Spaniards they killed in the Atirro rebellion in 1564:

\[Juan Vázquez de Coronado\] was received with armed hands and the insignias of the said dead men (M. Peralta 1883, 337).

Finally, and according to the documentary sources, the Huetar women didn't accompany the men to war, as the Coctu indian women did, in the South Pacific of Costa Rica. Juan Vázquez de Coronado recounts that these indians had such a custom, «for which they are called by the Güetares and other nations, Biritecas» (Vázquez de Coronado 1964, 50), In the opinion of E. Ibarra (personal conversation) the situation of Coctu was particular, because they were kept in large and enclosed rooms since they were threatened. Hence the women had to help.

# Phase 3. Japan and Qing Invasions [the early 17th century]

# 10. Japan invades - the Imjin War (1592-1598) [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasions_of_Korea_(1592%E2%80%931598))

Then finally the unified Japan invaded, led by Toyotomi Hideyoshi (a well-known name to most Koreans). Japan first asked for ""a free passage for Japanese troops en route to China,"" Joseon refused, and Japan soon invaded.

* For the reasons mentioned above, Japan had a stronger and larger market economy, soldiers with a lot more military experience, and muskets imported from the Portuguese.
* As I look back, what's kind of sobering is that **Joseon Korea did not have a well-trained army and a cadre of military generals. Many war heroes were outsiders and underdogs**. Deeply entrenched in Confucian orthodoxy and dependency on Ming China, Joseon did not care to maintain a functioning military. There was no way Joseon Korea could win the war alone.

Arriving at the Southeastern port city of Busan in May 1592, **the Japanese army took the entire Southeastern province in a week, and the king of Joseon fled from Seoul in 2 weeks** from the invasion. In 2 weeks from that, Japan took control of Seoul and the Northern city Pyongyang.

&#x200B;

However, the war went into a stalemate because of the three factors:

(a) Ming China's help ([Wanli Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanli_Emperor)). China sent a small army in August, and a large one in the following year

* Keeping it short because this part is not so much discussed in Korea...

(b) **Admiral Yi Sun-sin's 23 unexpected naval victories and control of the Southern sea**. Having no prior naval experience, [Yi Sun-sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Sun-sin) (a secondary naval commander back then in a Southwestern province of Korea) **won unexpected victories at sea with ridiculously few resources and support**. He remained undefeated until his death. His victories at sea **significantly disrupted the supply lines of Japan.**

* In the beginning of the war, he found himself in a situation where all the other commanders were killed or fleeing, and many coastal villages were pillaged and abandoned. His soldiers began to flee too, but he arrested and beheaded the escapees, and displayed their heads for discipline. By July, **his fleet was comprised of 24 warships, 15 small warships, and 46 fishing boats**.
* Japan was paying all their attention to the Northern front, and the Japanese navy in the Southern sea was just sailing along the coastline, busying themselves with looting and raping
   * Yi exchanged fires with some unexpecting Japanese ships in small battles, and identified their strengths and weaknesses. For example, the Korean warships were speedier and had a long artillery range, but the Japanese ships were big, carried many soldiers, and the soldiers had strength in on-board combats with their guns and battlefield experiences. Realizing that, Yi **built the famous** [**turtle ships**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_ship) **with a roof covered in iron spikes** (to prevent enemies' boarding)
   * He typically used a tactic of luring the Japanese fleet with a small, speedy Korean ship, and encircling the fleet with the Korean warships with long artillery ranges. He also later mastered the use of the sea currents, straits and knowledge of the sea
   * [Battle of Hansan Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasions_of_Korea_(1592%E2%80%931598)#Battle_of_Hansan_Island): **using a strait, ""crane wing formation"" and turtle ships, he destroyed 59 Japanese ships and captured 12, while not losing a single Korean ship**. After this and another battle, Yi was promoted to the Naval Commander of the Three Provinces
* However, the hero was not properly acknowledged and welcomed by the king of Joseon. Framed by a double agent's [plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Sun-sin#Japanese_double-agent_plot), **he was beaten and tortured by the order of his king almost to death**. He was replaced by incompetent [Won Gyun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Won_Gyun) and was demoted to the rank of an infantry soldier
   * In a disastrous battle led by Won Gyun, the Korean fleet of 150 warships that Yi had been carefully building were destroyed; only 13 warships survived
* After the disaster, the king and court officials hurriedly pardoned and reinstated Yi as the Naval Commander. **While recovering from the torture by the king, Yi led another legendary battle with his 13 surviving ships defeating the Japanese fleet of 333 ships, destroying 31 of them, without losing a single Korean ship**. ([Battle of Myeongnyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Myeongnyang))
* Sadly, **the hero died in the last naval battle in this war**, in which Korea won an absolute victory and destroyed half of a large Japanese fleet of 500 ships. He was fatally shot while commanding on the deck. He famously uttered to his son and his nephew:
   * ""**Do not announce my death**"" because the war was at its height. For the remainder of the battle, his nephew wore his armor and continued to beat the war drum

\*\* A lot of details of his life and his thought processes are described in his meticulous **war diary** ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjung\_ilgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjung_ilgi))

\*\* [Nakan-eupseong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naganeupseong) is one of the coastal villages that might preserve the appearance of the coastal villages at the time of this war.

\*\* Yi Sun-shin is also known for his battlefield use of folk traditions. Take a look at how he used [Ganggangsullae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganggangsullae#Feature_of_Korea's_traditional_society) (ancient circle dance of women) and [Kites](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/03/362_103566.html) in battles

\*\* Now, a big statue of Yi Sun-sin is standing in a central plaza of Seoul, [Gwanghwamun plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwanghwamun_Plaza)

&#x200B;

(c) Guerilla warfare

* [Grand Master Seosan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyujeong) and [Grand Master Samyeong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yujeong) are two famous Buddhist monks who led guerrilla wars against the Japanese force. They left a lot of folklore about their divine power to change the weather, etc. After the war, Samyeong was sent to Japan as an envoy, and rescued thousands of Koreans who had been taken prisoner.
* [Gwon Yul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwon_Yul) and [Gwak Jae-woo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwak_Jae-u) are two famous general/guerilla leaders from the scholarly class. Gwon Yul is known for his [Battle of Haengju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Haengju), where he defeated 30,000 Japanese soldiers with his 2,800 Korean troops
* [Nongae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nongae) was a gisaeng (courtesan), who killed a Japanese general by falling off a cliff with him (uhh... in a kind of Squid Game way in retrospect)

\*\* I later heard that Japan was puzzled about why the peasants and defeated villages in Korea still resisted so much, because the Japanese peasants would just submit to a new ruler. But to ethnic Koreans, Japan was a completely foreign land and culture after 1,000 years of separation (plus Koreans had dismissed them as ""dwarfs"" ""savages"" ""pirates"" for a long time). Koreans also viewed the Japanese samurai-style atrocities as barbaric and horrendous. This all contributed to anti-Japan patriotism

The Japanese ultimately ended the war in 1598 after the death of the shogun, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and returned to Japan.

&#x200B;

\[the legacy of the war\]

* Devastation of the economy - famine, epidemics, and poverty combined with the Little Ice Age in the 17th century
* **Atrocities**: the Japanese violence was so gory and brutal, Koreans viewed them as ""monsters"" and ""ghosts."" A famous story is that **the Japanese sliced the noses of killed soldiers and civilians as war trophies, and were rewarded based on the nose-count.** This story is true, and there's still a monument called [Ear Mound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimizuka) in Japan that **enshrines the severed noses of 38,000 Koreans and 30,000 Chinese**. The original name was Nose Mound, but it would later be changed to Ear Mound, **because the Japanese thought that Nose Mound sounded too horrible**
   * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege\_of\_Jinju\_(1593)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jinju_(1593)) all the soldiers and civilians (tens of thousands) were killed in the southeastern coastal city of Jinju
* In the midst of the massacres and plunders, the Japanese kept [Korean ceramic artisans alive](https://www.thoughtco.com/ceramic-wars-hideyoshis-japan-kidnaps-koreans-195725) and took them to Japan. It is said that the ceramic technology was ""stolen"" - but according to some records, some artisans would not want to return to Joseon Korea because artisans and craftsmen were better treated in Japan (which had a thriving market economy) vs. Korea (Confucian orthodox)
* **Crops of the Americas**
   * In terms of the material culture, something very interesting happened -- during the war, **chili peppers and tobacco were introduced to the Korean peninsula** (via Japan via the Portuguese) even though Koreans had no idea about the origin of the crops. Some ethnic Koreans were captured and sold as slaves by the Portuguese merchants, far and away
      * **the spicy kimchi** as we know now evolved after this point. Before the chili peppers, kimchi was white and not spicy
   * Tobacco was quickly popularized after the war. Interestingly, ""**smoking tiger**"" became a common motif in Korean folk traditions. ([link for a folk painting](https://imgur.com/a/OOqsFPw)) A Korean equivalent of ""long, long time ago"" is ""In a time when tigers used to smoke""
* Ming China's fall
   * I heard that this war partially accelerated the decline of the Ming Empire, which would soon conquered by the Manchu (Jurchen)-led Qing

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 11. Manchu Qing rises; a pragmatic king of Joseon gets dethroned by a conservative neo-Confucian faction

* While the king Seonjo was hiding from the war, one of his sons, [**Gwanghae**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwanghaegun_of_Joseon)**, stayed during the war, set up a branch court, and fought battles**. He succeeded his father as the next king. He led quite nice domestic reforms to reconstruct the economy after the devastation. For example
   * Redistributed land to people
   * *Daedong* law - collecting taxes only in rice. This would make it easier for people to pay taxes
   * *Hopae* ID - made people to carry an ID called [hopae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopae) so that the state can track its (taxable) population again (after many villages were abandoned and emptied)
   * Compiling a [medical book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongui_Bogam) (led by a [royal chief physician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heo_Jun))
* Despite this, he was **largely unsupported** by many politicians, scholars, and aristocrats **because he was not the first-born son and he was born from a concubine**.
   * Writing this, at this point I feel personally irritated lol. Why weren't all these fundies killed by Japan
* He lost support for two reasons (1) *Gwanghae* had a young half-brother born from a legitimate queen. It is commonly thought that *Gwanghae* didn't want to kill him, but the faction that supported him did. The young boy was eventually sent into exile and executed
   * It seems that [The mother of the killed young boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Inmok) firmly believed that the king actively persecuted her son... her court maiden wrote an extensive diary about this event. It was written in the Korean script, which was widely used among women and commoners at this point
* (2) The Imjin war accelerated the decline of Ming China (Han Chinese), and **Manchu Qing Empire was rising in power.** *Gwanghae* was a practical ruler, and he tried to maintain friendly relationships with the Manchus. This upset Ming and the dogmatic Confucian scholars in Korea.
   * *Gwanghae* was still forced to [send a troop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_Hong-rip) to Manchuria to help the Ming dynasty. Joseon lost 2/3 of their troop in this doomed military operation
* Ultimately, a ""ultra-conservative"" [political faction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerners_(Korean_political_faction)) that opposed to him made a coup, and dethroned the king
   * He's often considered a victim of the crazy faction fighting that was worsening since the Phase 2.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 12. Qing Invasion (The Byeongja war): the King of Joseon surrenders and gives nine bows to the Manchu Emperor

* Joseon politics was a mess. After the coup, a new king Injo was enthroned, but one of the coup members was dissatisfied with his reward, made another coup, and [occupied Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injo_of_Joseon#Yi_Gwal_Rebellion). The economy was still devastated and an external threat (Manchu) was growing, but the aristocrats were only obsessed with court infighting.
* The ultra-conservative faction that took power abandoned pragmatism, and antagonized Manchu (""**because they're barbarians""**)
   * Manchu was a new name for Jurchen, a nomadic group in Manchuria (right north of the Korean peninsula) that had long interacted with Koreans. Koreans always had despised them as barbarians
   * But Manchus didn't hate Joseon Korea. They even shared a [holy mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paektu_Mountain)
* However, the conservative Joseon nobles eventually upset the rising Manchu empire. Qing eventually invaded Korea (it was before Qing conquered the entire China), and drove the fleeing king of Joseon into *Namhan Mountain Fortress*. Qing brought 100,000 soldiers - while Joseon could mobilize only a few thousands from its devastated economy
   * there's a [novel titled *Namhan Mountain Fortress* ](https://www.amazon.com/Namhansanseong-Korean-Kim-Hoon/dp/8956253536)which was popular in Korea
* In a siege, running out of food and supplies, the king of Joseon finally **surrendered, and ceremoniously bowed to the Qing Emperor nine times**. Joseon became Qing's vassal state, and the first and second sons of the Joseon king would be sent to China as captives

\*\* A general [Im Gyeongeop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im_Gyeong-eop) beheaded one of the Manchu generals, and later went to China to help restore the Ming Empire

* many people of Joseon thought that it was virtuous to be loyal to Ming, the legitimate preserver of Confucianism. Im is still enshrined in some shamanic shrines in Korea

Before uploading Part 3 and 4, I'm posting this sort of side story of literature development

\-----------

&#x200B;

# 15. The rise of vernacular literature

Despite the invention of the Korean alphabet in the 15th century, the male scholar-aristocrats still used classical Chinese to make poems and prose. Their poems in classical Chinese tend to be formulaic - talking about loyalty to the king, Confucian values, the same motif of pine trees and bamboos were used excessively

* Evergreen pine trees and bamboos were the symbols of unchanging loyalty. Plum flowers, orchids, and chrysanthemum were also common motifs that represented Confucian values
* In the previous *Silla* and *Goryeo* period there were poems written in [modified Chinese script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idu_script) (modified for denoting Korean grammars, similar to what Japanese did) and they tended to be more interesting thematically (see my previous [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xdnht8/goryeo_koreas_medieval_kingdom_918_1392_stories/))
   * However, as Joseon turned fundamentally neo-Confucian, the scholars censored un-Confucian themes such as ""infatuation between men and women (*nam-nyeo sang-yeol ji-sa*)""

However, around the 18th century, with the wider spread of the Korean alphabet (*hangeul*), Koreans started writing poems and novels ([sijo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sijo)) in vernacular Korean. **People in lower social classes and women started generating a lot of vernacular poems and prose**. They were a lot less formulaic in their themes, and contained many indigenous elements such as vulgar slangs and onomatopoeia (well Korean and Japanese languages are known for their exceptionally large inventories of onomatopoeia)

* [Kim Man-jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Man-jung), a scholar-aristocrat and novelist in the 17th century, once said that ""**the stories told by woodworkers and laundry maidens are a lot more valuable** than [yangban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangban)'s cookie-cutter poems"" (\* yangban = scholar-aristocrats)

The vernacular literature was both influenced by and critical of Confucianism: (a) it was heavily influenced by the dominant Confucian ideology (filial piety, women's chastity, etc) but (b) was **satirical of the orthodoxy and pretentiousness of the scholar-aristocrats**

&#x200B;

A lot of the vernacular literature was very earthy and satirical, as a reaction to the Confucian orthodox of the ruling class. **Together with the oppressive Confucian and patriarchal culture (**[**link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/wzqxuu/womens_oppression_in_joseon_era/)**), the earthy and satirical humor of folk culture would characterize the late Joseon culture**. A lot of what we know as ""traditional Korean culture"" have come from this culture of late Joseon era.

&#x200B;

\[1\] Poem/[Sijo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sijo)

Standard sijo (poem) follows this formula: 3 lines, 45 syllables (3/4 4/4 3/4 4/4 3/5/4/3). The first line introduces the theme, the second line expands it, and the third line twists it and impresses the audience by intoducing an unexpected theme

* However, a new type of sijo called ""*saseol sijo*"" broke the formula, typically by extending the second line of the poem, adding verbose, bubbly and often comical phrases

&#x200B;

Later sijo's common themes: **Deep, unchanging love**

>May my love become an alder tree of Kumsong in Hoeyang, and I am an arrowroot vine:  
>  
>Like a spider’s web around a butterfly, the vine goes round the tree, tightly this way, tightly that, wrongly loosened, properly wound, bound, then loosened from down below, all the way to the top, tightly winding round and round, without a single gap, and unchanging, day and night, it’s coiled around, twisting.  
>  
>Though, in the heart of winter, we bear wind, rain, snow, and frost. Could we ever be apart?  
>  
>(*Yi Chong-bo*)

&#x200B;

Later sijo's common themes: **Women's suffering**

>Mother-in-law, do not stamp on the kitchen floor for hatred of your daughter-in-law!  
>  
>Was she payment for a debt, was she bought for a price? Father-in-law, severe as a sprig from the rotting stump of a chestnut tree; mother-in-law, shriveled as sun-baked cattle dung; sister-in-law, sharp as a new gimlet poking from a straw bag woven three years ago, and — like a poor crop on a field that’s made for planting good grain, having borne a son like a bright yellow cucumber flower, who has the bloody flux,  
>  
>Daughter-in-law, like the bindweed on a fertile field: Why do they hate her so?  
>  
>(Source: [link](https://books.google.com/books?id=DK_Edn9hkx8C&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=%22A+toad+grabbed+a+fly+in+its+mouth+and+hopped+on+top+of+a+compost+pile%22&source=bl&ots=ECUESMyoD9&sig=ACfU3U1BB64r-CoZYK3yOaJDgwveuS-Zdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwih0t6K-8v6AhV0rIkEHaONAoEQ6AF6BAgFEAM#v=onepage&q=%22A%20toad%20grabbed%20a%20fly%20in%20its%20mouth%20and%20hopped%20on%20top%20of%20a%20compost%20pile%22&f=false) \- The Columbia Anthology of Traditional Korean Poetry)

&#x200B;

Later sijo's common themes: **Earthy humor; life as commoners**

>One night in Andong, after a tour of back-alley wine shops,  
>  
>As I staggered, head spinning, down the narrow, paddy-field path,  
>  
>The two pigs grunted, grunted, So, you! Home at last!

&#x200B;

>A toad grabbed a fly in its mouth and hopped on top of a compost pile.  
>  
>It looked across the mountain opposite, and saw a peregrine falcon hovering in flight. The toad shuddered, started, tumbled from atop the compost pile  
>  
>Fortunately the toad was exceptionally agile, otherwise severe contusions would have been its lot.  
>  
>(\*\* Can be interpreted as a commoner avoiding nobles or authorities like a toad hiding from a falcon. In Seoul's old district, there's still a [back-alley so narrow that horses couldn't enter](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2013/07/320_42052.html) \- commoners used it to avoid nobles)

&#x200B;

\[2\] Pansori

An oral tradition/stories sung by (often traveling) professional singers (a genre called [Pansori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansori)) became a national culture. The most popular stories have **strong Confucian-influenced themes (filial piety, women's chastity, rewards to good deeds)** and now commonly taught to Korean children through children's books

* The song of Simcheong:
   * the story of a filial daughter named Sim Cheong. **She offers herself as a sacrifice for 300 sacks of rice needed for her blind father to regain his eyesight**. Sailors bought her as a sacrifice to ""appease"" the dragon king in the sea. However, the dragon king is moved by her virtue, and sends her back in a lotus flower, to be shown to the emperor of China. She is chosen as his new wife, and she becomes the empress of China.
   * In order to find her father, she hosts a feast for the blind. He shows up, but when Sim Cheong cries ""Father!"", he denies and insists that his daughter is dead. Sim Cheong somehow demonstrates that she is indeed his daughter (I forgot this part), they reunite in tears and live happily ever after.
* The song of Chunhyang:
   * the story of the virtuous daughter of a gisaeng (courtesan) who stayed **loyal and chaste** for her scholarly-aristocrat lover, who had left for a civil service exam. In the meantime, **a greedy magistrate orders her to ""serve"" him, but she refuses and is put into prison**, wearing [a sort of pillory](https://9gag.com/gag/adL2Egj). However, her lover comes back as a high official with a king's mission, punishes the corrupt magistrate and rescues her. They live happily ever after.
      * \*\* She's 16 years old (""*2x8 youth*"") and often portrayed as riding a swing, standing on it. Swinging was a way young, noble women could see the outside world, because they were confined within the walls of their residence
* The song of Heungbu:
   * the story of a poor brother/rich brother.  A greedy, rich brother is very mean to his poor brother (and his family). One day a poor brother heals an injured swallow. The swallow repays his kindness by bringing a magical gourd seed. Huge gourds grow on the thatch of his humble house. When they cut the gourds open, gold, silver, and jewels pour out from the gourds. The rich brother tries to replicate it, but he gets punished
* The song of Sugung (the Sea Palace):
   * the dragon king is sick, and his illness can be cured by taking a rabbit's liver. The dragon king sends a terrapin (small turtle) to find and bring a rabbit from the earth. A rabbit is taken to the sea palace, but soon it realizes that it will be slaughtered. The rabbit tricks the dragon king, and escapes, ridiculing the dumb king. This song is particularly filled with earthy and farcical humor, and lengthy verbal imitations of animals
* The song of Jeokbyeok (Red Wall):
   * About the famous Chiense battle of Red Wall. The basic story is from the Romance of the (Chinese) Three Kingdoms (which is an oral tradition in China itself), but this Korean version focuses a lot more on **ridiculing kings and nobles** who cause wars
* Plus there are some less-known songs such as ""a story of pheasant husband and wife"" (the husband is pathetic and demands the wife not to remarry after his death, but she ignores him)
   * and a shamanic saga Baridegi (**the seventh princess of a king is abandoned because she's a daughter and unwanted**, but she goes into the underworld to find a cure for her father's treatment)
* There are also a lot of theater pieces (village ground theaters) - [with masks](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthlingPorn/comments/x54mfv/a_scene_from_bongsan_talchum_a_traditional_korean/). The common theme is ridiculing and satirizing arrogant and pretentious scholar-aristocrats

\*\* There's a beautiful, sad classic movie about the Pansori singers (1991) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seopyeonje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seopyeonje))

&#x200B;

\[3\] Novels and essays written in the Korean script

* Hong Gil-dong: [Translated in English (Penguin classics)](https://www.amazon.com/Story-Hong-Gildong-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143107690)
   * This is a story of a sort of Korean **Robin Hood**. Hong Gil-dong is born as the son of a concubine and noble father, and he's treated as a low status outsider to the family - **He ""can't call his brother ""brother"", and can't call his father ""father""""** He can't take the civil service exam, so his upward mobility is restrained by his birth
   * Then he becomes the head of a bandit, learns magic and tactics, **steals from the rich and gives to the poor**. Later he establishes his kingdom in a mythical island (*yuldo-guk*)
   * The name ""Hong Gil-dong"" is still used in Korean documents like John Doe
   * A real bandit leader [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im\_Kkeokjeong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im_Kkeokjeong) was the inspiration for this novel
* Court women's diaries and essays
   * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naehun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naehun) ""Instructions for the inner (chamber)"" or ""Instructions for Women"" - the oldest surviving work written by a royal woman (strongly conservative and Confucian)
   * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs\_of\_Lady\_Hyegyeong ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_Lady_Hyegyeong)mentioned above (section 14)
   * Diary of a court maiden - mentioned above (section 11)

&#x200B;

\[4\] Novels written in the classical Chinese script

* Kim Man-jung's work: he wrote in classical Chinese and, and wrote novels set in ancient China (as a fantastic setting)
   * The Cloud Dream of the Nine [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Cloud\_Dream\_of\_the\_Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cloud_Dream_of_the_Nine)
      * English translation ([Penguin classics](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/553113/the-nine-cloud-dream-by-kim-man-jung-translated-with-an-introduction-and-notes-by-heinz-insu-fenkl/))
      * a story of a man having a love affair with nine female immortals - filled with Confucian and Buddhist themes
   * Lady Sa's Southward Journey ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_of_Lady_Sa%27s_Southward_Journey)) - the journey of an ugly, yet courageous and virtuous woman - she eventually becomes beautiful and becomes an empress
* [Park Ji-won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bak_Jiwon_(born_1737))'s satirical work:
   * The story of Heo Saeng:
      * Heo Saeng is a poor/fallen scholar-aristocrat who tried the civil service exam for 10 years but never succeeded. His wife complains, and one day he runs out of his house and borrows 10,000 nyang (coins) from a wealthy man. With that, he **buys up all the fruits in Seoul and all the horsehair** (used to make [scholars' hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gat_(hat))) **in Jeju island, raising the price ten-fold, and he makes massive profits**. But he laments how easy it is to manipulate Joseon's economy, and laments the primitive and undeveloped economy
   * The story of Ho-jil:
      * The story of a tiger (or tiger spirit) eating up scholar-aristocrats
   * A grumpy aristocrat and rebel, he was tall, had a loud voice and was interested in folklore, apocryphal stories, and ordinary people's culture. He fiercely hated his fellow aristocrats - ""useless, pretentious, and idle""
* ""The Songs of Monthly Events of Farmers""
   * A record of folk traditions, festivals, and [calendar events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunfen) for farmers. I don't know why I had to learn about this in my high school literature class (what's the literary value?), but it was beautiful anyways

\[5\] Folk motifs - I can't list everything, but common motifs found in late-Joseon folk culture are:

* **Women's suffering** \- a woman dying during a childbirth, woman [throwing herself](https://world.kbs.co.kr/service/contents_view.htm?lang=e&board_seq=379615) into a river after abuses of her mother-in-law and husband, female ghosts who were unjustly killed appearing to a village magistrate, etc.....
   * A straw rope (called *golden rope*) was hung over a gate of a house to announce a new baby - if the baby was a boy, they attached chili peppers to (proudly) announce that it was a son
      * Uh ""chili pepper"" and ""(child's) penis"" are homophones in the Korean language... because they look similar??
      * Until like the 80s, it was common to take a photo of a male child with his penis exposed on his ""1st birthday celebration"" ([dol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doljanchi)) - because it's something to be proudly displayed
* The belief that **lepers** abduct babies and eat their liver to cure leprosy. I don't know if Korean lepers really did that, but this stereotype was so common that I still remember seeing on TV the image of a leper wandering in vast, yellow grassfields looking for a human baby
   * The Japanese later built a [leper colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorokdo)/concentration camp for lepers on a Southwestern island. Lots of abuses happened there, and the colony still exists there.
* There were **all-male troupes** called [Namsadang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namsadang) that performed theater arts, acrobatics, drumming, and village ritual music (which is a bit shamanic and trance-inducing: [Pungmul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pungmul)). There was often a male actor who played a female role (similar to Japan), and **homosexuality** was common in those troupes. A popular movie about it: [The King and the Clown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_and_the_Clown)
* **Singing beggars** \- There was a [tradition](https://world.kbs.co.kr/service/contents_view.htm?lang=e&menu_cate=culture&id=&board_seq=12630&page=7&board_code=trendkorea) of homeless performers tapping on empty tins with spoons and singing and dancing at the doors of rich people. Later [some](https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=2598589) developed into performance art

&#x200B;

\*\* There was a parallel trend in paintings - classical Chinese style vs. vernacular/folk style

* Court painters followed the Chinese style: [Gim Hongdo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gim_Hongdo), [An Gyeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Gyeon), [Jeong Seon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Seon)
   * [Sin Yun-bok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_Yun-bok) has a distinct and realistic style. He painted lots of women, scenes from everyday life in Joseon. One of the most famous traditional painters of Joseon
   * [Jang Seung-eop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jang_Seung-eop) is also famous for his distinct style - there's a movie about him ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-hwa-seon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-hwa-seon))

<>

* **Folk painting** ([Minhwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minhwa)):
   * Personally I find them a lot more interesting. For example smoking tigers ([image](https://imgur.com/a/615SABr))

262,Was this behavior and culture like that with the wealthy Englishmen in the early 20th century?,32,y9gsut,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/y9gsut/was_this_behavior_and_culture_like_that_with_the/,14,"There's a thing I've noticed with watching programs that deal with the wealthy class of English on around the 1920's and a bit onward. Shows like 'Brideshead Revisited' and 'Jeeves and Wooster' have the characters behave and live in a somewhat quirky manner. It's an almost care-free, childlike existence and culture. They often divulge in traditions, slang, and mannerisms that border on outlandish and esoteric. Example I can show is this [scene here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_56re3J-Vos) from 'Brideshead Revisited' and [this scene](https://youtu.be/Te3SvM-aG04?t=454) from 'Jeeves and Wooster'.

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

I’m in a debate with some friends about horses and how common they were. I’m taking the stance that horse ownership was pretty
Common in a lot of cultures and they were part of everyday life for most people. They are taking the stance that only the elite and Nobel had horses. I understand that in Europe during the time of kings and colonial America horses were most commonly owned by the wealthy. But even at that my understanding was that most people who had a farm even if it was small had a horse. I’m also making the argument that the tribes and nomads of Eurasia where horses first became domesticated would have had a culture where every warrior would have their own horse. I’m not really finding great results on the Google so I figured someone here may be able to help point me in the right direction or have some cool knowledge to share. Thank you!

Here's a bit long, yet extremely simplified account of 3,500 years of Chinese history. 

&#x200B;

**Pre-historic time**: There were neolithic cultures scattered throughout the modern-day China ([Longshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longshan_culture) for example) - they might have not belonged to the same ethnic group.

* From 1900 - 1500 BC, there was **an early bronze age culture** called [Erlitou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlitou_culture). Some argue that this is where the legendary Xia dynasty was. There's another [bronze culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxingdui) \[1700 BC-\] in nearby Sichuan.
* Overall, Chinese bronze age started about 4,000 years ago.

&#x200B;

# [When Chinese kingdoms were small]

**Shang dynasty** \[1600 - 1045 BC\]: I wrote a [separate post about Shang](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xuyk74/bronze_age_china_shang_dynasty_1600_1045_bc/), if anyone's interested.

* The modern **Chinese characters evolved from their** [**Oracle bones**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone) **and divination practices** (pyromancy).
* They made lots of interesting bronze artifacts. [The last king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Zhou_of_Shang) and his [consort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daji) are known for their extravagant ""pond of wine, forest of meat."" The dynasty was toppled and replaced by

(Early) **Zhou dynasty** \[1045 - 771 BC\]: It was a **decentralized, yet hierarchical confederation of small kingdoms**, with the kingdom of Zhou on top, and its vassal states (related by blood lineages).

* Shang dynasty was a small kingdom based on the inner Yellow River basin, but Zhou's vassal states spread far and away from the Yellow River basin. The vassal states, belonging to the same ethnic or language group, were spread across [the Central plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongyuan), Shandong peninsula, modern-day Beijing area, etc. So the **main territory of Northern China** was already occupied by this group back then.
* It had a strict **social hierarchy** ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fengjian)) and many elaborated rituals, which was praised by Confucius later. The culture was patriarchal, and **patrilinearity (continuing paternal bloodline)** was considered important. The origin of son preference in China.

**Spring and Autumn period** \[771 - 476 BC\]: The ""harmonious"" system of Zhou collapsed, and power struggle between the small kingdoms began.

* Confucius was born during this time and he missed the Golden Ages of Zhou a lot. People were using bamboo scrolls for writing, and **Confucius compiled and wrote a lot of bamboo scrolls**. One of his history books is titled ""Spring and Autumn"" - from which the period is named.
* Confucius also traveled across the small kingdoms from East to West of Northern China. His idea (""govern people by virtue and rituals"" was not popular back then, though.
* [Hundred Schools of Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Schools_of_Thought) flourished, because many kings and nobles hosted philosophers and scholars, and bought the ideas. The golden age of Chinese philosophy.

**Warring States period** \[475 - 221 BC\]: The many small states eventually **consolidated into 7 kingdoms**. Intense wars followed. Philosophers Mencius and Zhuangzi were active in this era.

&#x200B;

# [First unified empires]

**Qin dynasty** \[221 - 210 BC\]: [Qin Shi Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang), the first emperor, unifies China. He's often depicted as a terrifying tyrant. He built

* [The Great Wall of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China) \- lots of forced labor mobilized
* [The Mausoleum and Terracotta Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum_of_the_First_Qin_Emperor) \- it is said that he was obsessed with achieving immortality (Taoist influence), and took mercury believing that it was medicinal. His tomb was full of mercury.
* I found a great write-up about the important legacies of Qin's institutions:
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vjhwc9/the\_rise\_and\_fall\_of\_chinas\_first\_empire\_the\_qin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vjhwc9/the_rise_and_fall_of_chinas_first_empire_the_qin/)

Intermittent:

* [Liu Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han) defeats [Xiang Yu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiang_Yu) \- The defeat of a Southern kingdom, [Chu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_(state))
   * Chu was considered exotic and tropical - full of **ethnic tribes, exotic animals and plants** \- the poems from Chu are passed down in [Songs of Chu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_Ci)

**Han dynasty** \[202 BC - 220 AD\]: The first long-lasting unified empire in China. **The Han Chinese is named after this era**. The kingdom prospered, and culture flourished. It was also the first dynasty that promoted Confucianism as the main state ideology.

* [Emperor Wu of Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wu_of_Han) engaged in many conquest wars, and vastly expanded the territory of the Chinese empire. He was the one that **conquered the territories of Southern China**, which were predominantly inhabited by different ethnic tribes.
   * Modern day Thai people, for example, originated from the ethnic minorities who were living in the Southern provinces of China back then. ([Tai-Kadai languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kra%E2%80%93Dai_languages))
   * Southern provinces in China still speak different languages (e.g. [Cantonese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese)) influenced by the indigenous languages of **non-Sinitic ethnic groups**. Also, there are still many different ethnic groups in the mountainous regions of Southern China (e.g. [Hmong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_people)).
* This was also the time when the **Silk Road** was built.
* An excellent write-up about Han:

\*\* Jesus was born during this period

&#x200B;

# [Cycles of Division and Unification] 

**Three Kingdoms** period \[220-280 AD\]

* At the end of the Han dynasty, a peasant rebellion driven by a [Taoist cult](https://www.reddit.com/r/mythology/comments/y5uzvb/zhang_jue_a_taoist_sorcerer_who_led_the_yellow/) swept across the empire. Han Dynasty falls, and the three kingdom period begins. 
* This period would become one of the most dramatized periods in Chinese history by **a 14th-century historical saga** [**the Romance of Three Kingdoms**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms). Any Chinese, Korean, and Japanese person knows the basic characters in the saga. 
   * The famous opening line of this saga is ""**The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.** Thus it has ever been""
* I wrote up [a very basic introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/mythology/comments/y5tbop/the_romance_of_the_three_kingdoms_184280_ad_one/) to the Romance of Three Kingdoms. Someone made a lot more thorough summary of the saga ([here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fdqjbIEejuUIP1kHzOzR3tEl9i1G3dQ0nzrMd25hu6Y/edit?usp=sharing)). 
* [The Battle of Red Cliffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/BattlePaintings/comments/i9nq8k/battle_of_red_cliffs_by_yan_yangli_wu_515x378/) is the most famous battle 

**Jin Dynasty and Sixteen Kingdoms** \[280 - 439 AD\] 

* Jin Dynasty unifies China... but soon, **non-Sinitic nomadic groups invaded Northern China and founded** [sixteen kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteen_Kingdoms). Jin would be kicked out to the South and continue to rule there.
* **Buddhism was introduced via Silk Road** to China around this period. [Dunhuang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunhuang) is a famous tourist attraction 

**Southern and Northern dynasties** \[420 - 589 AD\] 

* Buddhism becomes even more popular 

&#x200B;

**Sui dynasty** \[581 - 618 AD\] 

* Another short-lived unified empire. 
   * But they're famous because they **built the** [**Grand Canal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canal_(China)) that connects the Yellow River to Yangtze River. It is the longest canal in the world 

&#x200B;

**Tang dynasty** \[618 - 907 AD\] 

It is said that Tang was the mixture of Han Chinese and Northern nomadic groups. It was **the most cosmopolitan empire** in Chinese history. Muslims and Nestorian Christians had their districts in the Tang capital [Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an) (Xi'an still has a deep-rooted Muslim population) 

**Plump women were popular, and women engaged in sports and horseriding** \- they had more freedom. Buddhism and Taoism flourished. A type of elaborated figurines called [Sancai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sancai) (Three Shades) were popular. Tang merchants traded far and away via Silk Road 

Tang poetry would define Chinese poetry - led by poets such as [Li Bai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Bai) and [Du Fu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_Fu) 

The Tang culture also immensely influenced the surrounding East Asian culture -- notably Korea and Japan. Through Tang, Korea and Japan adopted ""**Chinese writing, Buddhism, and (Chinese style) legal codes.**"" Japan had a fledgling ancient kingdom back then, and **Heian Japan's new capital** [**Heian-kyo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian-ky%C5%8D) (modern day Kyoto) **was modeled after Xi'an**. Silla unified the Korean peninsula by forming an alliance with Tang. 

Interestingly: 

* Tang also had **the first and only female emperor** in Chinese history. [**Wu Zetian**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zetian) **was a consort of an emperor, but she took power, reigned as a de facto ruler, and eventually founded her own dynasty and announced herself as an emperor**. She killed her son in that process. What a character in many senses. Her reign was actually praised as effective and prosperous. 
* The Tang dynasty was weakened by the deadly [An Lushan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Lushan) rebellion: An was a general, and interestingly historical records suggest that he was a Caucasian (Sogdian, which was a type of Iranian). A portrait depicts him as having blue eyes 

&#x200B;

**Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period** \[907-979 AD\] 

* After Tang's fall, many kingdoms were founded by both Han Chinese and nomadic groups 

&#x200B;

# [Pendulum swing between Han Chinese vs Nomadic conquest dynasties]

**Song dynasty** \[960-1279 AD\]: perhaps the first Han Chinese empire that **had a stronger nationalistic sentiment against foreign influences**. An enhanced, more orthodox kind of Confucianism called [Neo-Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Confucianism) emerged. Unfortunately, the practice of **foot-binding** also spread during this time. 

* Being frugal was considered a virtue and many nobles wore white or less decorated clothes 
* **Imperial civil service examination**, which had emerged in Sui Dynasty first, now became established 
* As an reaction to An Lushan Rebellion, the military generals and military class were despised and suppressed - **scholarly virtues** were praised highly 

Then: 

* [Jurchen Jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_dynasty_(1115%E2%80%931234)) emerges: Jurchen, a Tungusic ethnic group from far-east Siberia (Manchuria), invaded the Northern China and took the territory (They're the direct ancestors of Manchus later) 
   * [Yue Fei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Fei) is a popular Han Chinese hero who fought against Jurchen Jin 
* Song, weakened by its scholarly and anti-military policies, **was pushed away into the Southern territory of China**. The Southern China was still **covered by tropical forests**, but during this time, lots of Han Chinese farmers went Southwards and developed the Southern China into a network of irrigated rice paddies. The land was wet and very fertile. Then, **gradually, the Southern China started becoming the economic center of China**. 
   * And many ethnic minorities would go further south, many into Southeast Asia. 

&#x200B;

**Yuan dynasty** \[1271-1368 AD\]: 

* Then Mongol came. Mongol violently devastated the Northern Jurchen Jin, but was relatively lenient to Southern Song (or, they learned how to deal with the Chinese). 
* The Mongols had a vast, vast empire and their trade network was truly extensive... 
* They **discriminated against the Han Chinese and hired foreigners** for high positions. 
* These types of dynasties are collectively called as [Conquest Dynasties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_dynasty) in China. Yuan dynasty is my major blind spot, I guess 

&#x200B;

**Ming dynasty** \[1366 - 1644 AD\]: Then, the pendulum swung again, and a Han Chinese empire reclaimed China. Famously, [Hongwu Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongwu_Emperor), a peasant from an impoverished family in the central part of China, led an army to expel Mongols, and founded a new dynasty ([Heaven's Mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven)). 

During Ming era, the **national Han Chinese folk culture** emerged that still survives in China. The Romance of Three Kingdoms and other folk literature such as [the Journey to the West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West) was written in this period. Christianity comes.

* **Christian missionaries** and European merchants started coming to China during this period. The Portuguese had a trading post in the [Moluccas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maluku_Islands) and [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau), and traded spice. **Silver** started flooding into China 
* Famously, [Zheng He](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He), an eunuch, commanded a fleet and **explored India and East Africa**, but soon such expeditions were banned. Ming China took an isolationist position. 
* **The Ming territory was confined to the territory of ethnic Han Chinese**. 

&#x200B;

**Qing dynasty** \[1636 - 1912 AD\]: Then, the pendulum swung again, and **Manchu (former Jurchen) troops came** to conquer China. 

* Qing was an interesting period - **the imperial family, who were ethnic Manchus, used** [**Manchu scripts**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_alphabet) as the language of court. The imperial clan was called [Aisin-Gioro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Aisin-Gioro). 
* **The Qing had a vast territory**, mainly through tributary relationships with five ethnic groups - **Manchus, Han Chinese, Mongols, Tibetans, and Hui (Muslims)**. Later, this would develop into a policy called [Five Races Under One Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Races_Under_One_Union) in the 20th century. A highly political topic now. 
   * [Kangxi emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Emperor) is often praised for his effective reign 
* The Manchu imperial family strived to maintain their ethnic identity. They had a summer palace in Manchuria, and the emperors regularly visited Manchurian cities like [Mukden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang) for summer activities and hunting 
* The Qing engaged in (moderate amount of) international trades, and **silver flooded into the economy**. In the 17th\~18th century, China was the wealthiest country in the world. Qing had an active migration policy, which encouraged (mainly Han Chinese) farmers to migrate to underdeveloped lands. During the Qing era, **the population increased threefold**.

&#x200B;

# The History of Joseon 

# Phase 1. Early prosperity [15th century]

Joseon in the first 100 years was a well-functioning, thriving medieval kingdom. Most Koreans have heard of this rhyme ""*Tae-Jung-Tae-Se-Mun-Dan-Se*"" which is the first syllables of the names of the first 7 kings. I classify the first 9 kings (including -*Ye-Sung*) in the Phase 1, ""Early prosperity""

&#x200B;

# 1. Foundation myths ([Taejo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taejo_of_Joseon))

I explained how the *Goryeo-Joseon* transition happened [in my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xdnht8/goryeo_koreas_medieval_kingdom_918_1392_stories/). The general Yi Seong-gye, who was enthroned by the Confucian ruling class, would be the founder and progenitor of the 500 years of Joseon dynasty (or Yi dynasty).

Unlike his descendants (kings) who would be forever tormented with endless Confucian lectures from scholars and bureaucratic works, Yi was basically a military man. He grew up in a Northern military post in Korea that was directly controlled by Mongols. I don't know if he spoke some Mongolian, but at least he had close non-Korean friends such as an ethnic Tungusic (Jurchen) [Lee Ji-ran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chonghae_Yi_clan).

He also had a close Buddhist monk advisor, [Muhak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhak). There's many myths about him

* The monk was a geomancer, and located the site for the new capital, *Han-yang*, which is an old name for modern-day Seoul. **Seoul is famously located based on Feng Shui principles** \- ""With back to the mountain (to the North) and facing the water (to the South)""
* Another [legend](https://books.google.com/books?id=rJCboIyd__4C&pg=PA318&lpg=PA318&dq=muhak+rafter&source=bl&ots=XJaCE3hkPg&sig=ACfU3U0l-b_4TZh47vj7uhS4fKRfEQ6-Lg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjGy7bF25_6AhXPg4kEHR4iArMQ6AF6BAgiEAM#v=onepage&q=muhak%20rafter&f=false): Yi once had a peculiar dream. He entered an old rundown house. The floor creaked, the pillars shook, and the roof was about to cave in. Yi escaped right as the house collapsed with a boom. When he escaped, there were three rafters placed across his back.
   * According to the legend, after hearing this, the **Buddhist monk prophesied** that that Yi was going to be the founder of a new dynasty. ""The old house is the *Goryeo* dynasty, and you escaped with three rafters in the shape that resembles the Chinese character **""king"" (王, wang)**

&#x200B;

\*\* In China, royalty and auspiciousness was symbolized by **""dragons"" and ""jade.""** Joseon Korea followed the same symbolism. King's face was referred to as ""dragon face,"" king's robe was ""dragon robe,"" king's belt was a ""jade belt,"" king's seals was ""jade seals,"" and king's voice was ""jade voice."" Finding and possessing the Jade seal was a big deal because it was thought that the seal somehow finds its way to a ruler who has ""the Heaven's Mandate"" uh.... like One Ring in LOTR, lol.

* Many Koreans are familiar with these trivia from period k-dramas. There's a nice recent one titled ""[Six Flying Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Flying_Dragons)"" (2015) (the title used medieval Korean words). I grew up watching ""[Tears of the Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_of_the_Dragon_(TV_series))"" (1996) that was set in the same period

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 2. The founder's 5th son kills his half-brothers and takes the throne ([Taejong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taejong_of_Joseon))

The aforementioned k-drama ""[Six Flying Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Flying_Dragons)"" (2015) and ""[Tears of the Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_of_the_Dragon_(TV_series))"" (1996) are based on this story. The founder's [5th son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taejong_of_Joseon), *Yi Bang-won*, was **the most ambitious son** who had helped his father on many military campaigns and operations - including the assassination of a famous [Goryeo loyalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Mong-ju) (it is said that the blood stain is still visible on a bridge in present-day North Korea)

However, the founder's close [neo-Confucian advisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Do-jeon) insisted that the youngest (8th) son be the crown prince, so that Joseon will become **an ideal kingdom that is led by a scholarly council, not by absolute monarchy**. This infuriated the 5th son.

Then the wife of the founder king died (a mother of the 8th son, step-mother to the 5th son). When the father was in the mourning, the **5th son broke into the palace with his soldiers and killed the advisor and two of his half-brothers**, including the young crown prince.

The two murdered princes were born from the founder king's favorite wife, who had just died and he was mourning for. In shock and disgust, the founder king abdicated, and secluded himself in the Northern border city [Hamheung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamhung) which was close to his childhood hometown.

* **Disappearing messengers**: It is well-known that the 5th son tried to send messengers to his father many times - for forgiveness, for his endorsement, and most importantly, the Jade seal. However, those messengers **never returned** \- **the father shot all of them with his arrows**.
   * Originated from this, there's a Korean idiom ""Hamheung messenger"" to refer to people who are very slow to return or reply.

The 5th son first enthroned his [eldest brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeongjong_of_Joseon) to appease his father. But soon the puppet king abdicated (he was terrified), and the 5th son became the next king.

There are different versions of stories about how the father and son reconciled. In a[ story](https://thetalkingcupboard.com/portfolio/king-taejo-and-the-disappearing-messengers/), the father was finally persuaded by his trusted Buddhist monk advisor to see his son again. The son (now the king) went out of his way to welcome his father, building tents on the way

* However, upon seeing the son, the father's anger flared again and he shot his son with his arrow with the intention to kill him. But the son successfully defended himself with a shield. After this violent encounter, the father finally released his anger and they reconciled

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 3. Taejong's eldest son chooses freedom over the throne; his brother, the third son, becomes Sejong the Great and creates the Korean alphabets ([Sejong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_the_Great))

Taejong (the 5th son)'s eldest son [Yangnyeong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prince_Yangnyeong), as opposed to his father, **had little interest in the throne.** Folklore says that he was a **""chill guy"" who loved hunting, calligraphy, and women**. He was a rebellious teen - he ran away from the palace, and hung out with commoners and *gisaeng*s (geisha/courtesan). Perhaps watching his father killing his uncles affected his attitude.

He had a younger brother (the third son of *Taejong), Chung-nyeong*, who loved reading and studying. One day, the young smart boy (the third son) got a cold. The king saw his boy reading a book in his sickbed. That day the king realized that *Chung-nyeong* had a better quality as the next king for his Confucian kingdom than the crown prince.

Some say that the crown prince **misbehaved so that his father and court officials would take away his crown he didn't want**. True or not, they indeed stripped him of the crown and gave it to the king's smart third son.

* *Yangnyeong*, who voluntarily gave up his crown, had an amazing life ever since - traveling around, enjoying his life, and still being connected to all the influential politicians at that time. According to their genealogy, the first President of South Korea is a direct descendant of this guy.

And **the smart third son became the famous King Sejong**, who Koreans often refer to as [Sejong the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_the_Great).

* His most famous achievement is **the creation of the Korean alphabet,** [Hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul). The Korean ruling class used the classical Chinese for writing, but it was extremely difficult to write Korean sounds and native words using the logograms.
   * He gave the task to a group of young talented scholars, including [Shin Suk-ju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Suk-ju). There's a story about him - one day Shin stayed up night working hard, and fell asleep on the table in his court office. The next morning, Shin realized that someone put a robe on him, and it was the king's robe. He felt ecstatic about this, and bowed towards the royal chamber multiple times in the cold morning air.
   * Hangul is a **phonetic alphabet and very easy for commoners to learn** (it also has a reputation of being easy for foreign learners). The idea of a phonetic alphabet was not something new because Koreans had already been exposed to Mongolic scripts, but the shape and rules of the alphabets were **completely indigenous**.
   * The aristocrats hated this new alphabet, and dismissed it as a writing system for low class. However, it slowly spread to the commoners and, particularly, women. By the late Joseon period, **Korean vernacular literature would flourish**. (section 15)
   * Contemporary Koreans take great pride in the alphabet - commonly referred to as ""the most scientific alphabet in the world,"" lol. I don't know if it's true but it's a great alphabet.
* Famous books he compiled:
   * Introduction to the new script: ""[The Correct/Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunminjeongeum)""
   * First poetry book written in the new alphabet: [Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongbieocheonga)
   * Literature book ""Songs of the Moon Shining on a Thousand Rivers""
   * A book about Buddhism ""Episodes from the Life of Buddha""
      * This is ironic because he also suppressed Buddhism and banned monks to enter the capital
   * Farming guideline for commoners: ""[Straight Talk on Farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nongsa_jikseol)""

\*\* There's a mythology/fantasy novels written by a Korean scholar at this time (Tales of Geumo) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geumo\_Sinhwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geumo_Sinhwa). In this early Joseon period, you still see the strong influence of Buddhist mysticism on Korean culture. Many of the stories are about **a man falling in love with a female ghost or fairy from a distant past.** Uhh this oddly sounds k-drama!

&#x200B;

* Famous people:
   * [Jang Youngsil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jang_Yeong-sil): **a court slave who was promoted to be the chief court engineer**. He was an engineering genius and built sundials, water clocks, rain measurement, printing press, astronomical instruments, etc. Unfortunately, a [litter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(vehicle)#Korea) he built for the king broke down, and he was expelled from the court (despite the king's opposition)
   * [Hwang Hee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Hui): a politician who was the highest royal minister for 18 years. He's known to have **lived in a very humble house, and was a ""good neighborhood grandpa"" to the children in his neighborhood**. He was a perfect Confucian [ideal man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junzi)
   * [Choi Mu-seon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choe_Museon): a military engineer who figured out how to produce gunpowder locally
   * [Yi Jongmu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Jongmu): a military general who subdued Japanese pirates from Tsushima island (the nearest Japanese island to Korea. You can see the Korean city of Busan from Tsushima)
* Less known fun facts
   * It's known that he was a tall and big man, and he had 11 wives and 25 children
   * **One of his daughters-in-law was lesbian** and had an affair with two court maidens. When it was caught, the poor Bong Sunbin got expelled and honor-killed by her own family ([https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4s8ect/whatever\_happened\_to\_bong\_sunbin\_joseon\_koreas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4s8ect/whatever_happened_to_bong_sunbin_joseon_koreas/))

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 4. Sejong the Great's second son kills a boy king (uncle kills his nephew) and takes the throne ([Sejo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejo_of_Joseon))

Sejong's eldest son died early, and his 12-year-old eldest son was enthroned. Throughout the Chinese history that had adopted the **agnatic primogeniture** early on, this was a recurring problem and normally didn't end well

I wouldn't go deep into the details here, but in a nutshell, Sejong's second son (known as ""Grand Prince Suyang""), **the boy king's 38-year-old** [**uncle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejo_of_Joseon)**, made a coup** and exiled the boy king. Later, the poor boy was ordered to take poison and die.

* **Bestowal of poison** was a common way to execute a noble - you see that trope in period k-drama all the time. The thick, black liquid that resembles Chinese herbal medicine normally comes in a porcelain bowl. What was actually in that liquid is unclear.
* A court official named [Han Myeong-hoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Myeong-hoe) contributed to the coup the most. As a reward, his daughters married the new king's princes.

=> **The coup hurt the neo-Confucian ideal of preserving proper social norms** (and thus the harmony of the world). This would sow the seeds of political factions and legitimacy disputes, which would forever plague the Joseon politics

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 5. [Seongjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seongjong_of_Joseon) successfully reigns for 20 years / bans the remarriage of widows and executes ""unchaste"" women

* After the king Sejo's death, his eldest surviving son succeeded him, but he died in a year. After that, the guy's nephew (king Sejo's eldest grandson) succeeded him - Seongjong.
* He's the last king in the period I titled as ""early prosperity."" He was an ideal Confucian ruler. He lived long, cared about his kingdom, and tried to promote the Confucian ideology
   * It is said that he used to disguise as a common noble and come out of his palace at night, to see the commoners' lives with his eyes
   * He also finished the compilation of code of law ([State Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongguk_daejeon))
   * the centralization of the governance of local counties was almost completed
* During his reign, women's situation significantly deteriorated, though
   * The Joseon regime had gradually been stripping various women's rights, and this time, the king enacted the ""**widow remarriage ban**."" A [woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Guji) in a royal clan committed suicide when she was caught living with her slave after being widowed.
   * Eo-u-dong, a **famous** [**courtesan, dancer, and poet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uhwudong) **from a noble family, got executed** for  with being ""unchaste"" with multiple men
* He obtained **his crown prince from his concubine, who was executed for her jealousy** later on
   * She was 2nd rank concubine, which was quite high. If you watch k period drama, you will be familiar with the complex rank system in the royal harem. After she gave birth to the crown prince, she was promoted to the rank of queen
   * She was jealous of other concubines - **one night, she clawed her husband, leaving visible scratch marks on his sacred ""dragon face.""** The King tried to conceal the injury, but his mother, Queen Dowager Insu, discovered it and ordered the queen to be deposed and sent into exile
   * **The neo-Confucian court officials petitioned for her death** for her grave sin. She was ordered to take poison - in deadly bitterness, **she vomited blood on a cloth, and gave it to her mother, asking her to give it to her son (crown prince) later on**.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# The History of Joseon 

# Phase 2. The Cycles of Literati Purges [16th century]

After the deposed queen's ominous death, one of the biggest soap opera moments in Joseon history would take place. This would start the cycles of literati purges, which would characterize the Joseon history ever since

Overall, it was a period when **the initial neo-Confucian idealism was constantly frustrated by human nature, emotions, irrationality of monarchs, and the systematic problem** of the Confucian succession system

&#x200B;

# 6. The Deposed Queen Yun's son becomes the king, learns the truth of his birth, takes bloody revenge on the Confucian scholars, and turns the Royal Confucian Academy into a brothel

[Yeonsan-gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeonsangun_of_Joseon), the next king, would not receive his temple name (as a revered king) because he would be overthrown as a tyrant. Young Yeonsan did not know this though. He grew up believing that his mother was a normal queen, the third wife of his father

He was an intelligent man, but showed early signs of his violent side by killing his tutor. He soon learned about who was his real biological mother, and got very emotional about that.

He wanted to restore her title and honor. However, the neo-Confucian court officials (that belonged to a more **orthodox faction) opposed to it** (often depicted as group-chanting ""It is not as it should be, Your Majesty"" in k dramas)

Greatly frustrated by this, when a rival faction accused the orthodox faction of something minor, the king ordered the execution of many of the faction members. ([The First Literati Purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_literati_purges#First_literati_purge_of_1498))

Then a man approached the king with the details of his mother's execution, and **showed him the cloth with her vomited blood on it**. This is one of the most dramatized moments in Joseon period  drama - Yeonsan became extremely upset and destabilized.

**A bloodbath ensued** \- he beat to death two of his father's concubines, pushed his grandmother to death, and executed many court officials. He beheaded the corpses of dead court officials. He also executed innocent court officials for the crime of ""not having done anything to save his mother"" ([The Second Literati Purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_literati_purges#Second_literati_purge_of_1504))

After the killing spree, he **closed the** [**Royal Confucian academy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungkyunkwan)**, and turned it into his personal brothel** with young women taken from all provinces. He killed anyone who dared to say anything - he ordered his ministers to wear a sign that read:

>A mouth is a door that brings in disaster; a tongue is a sword that cuts off a head. A body will be in peace as long as its mouth is closed and its tongue is deep within

When the chief eunuch dared to tell him to behave better, **he killed him and cut off his limbs by himself** (at this point he went complete psycho). He also punished the eunuch's relatives down to the [7th degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_familial_exterminations)

After 9 years of tyranny, court officials finally [launched a coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungjong_coup), deposed him, and sent him into exile. He died two months later (potentially killed). His favorite concubine [Jang Nok-su](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jang_Nok-su), who often enabled and encouraged his violence, was also executed (she's another common figure in k drama).

&#x200B;

\*\* Another article about him: [Tales from the past: Joseon's Caligula](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2020/08/721_290739.html)

\*\* He was a psycho, but I find it interesting that the degeneration of the Confucian orthodoxy was started by an unjustly murdered woman's son

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 7. The tyrant's half-brother is enthroned; a young, popular neo-Confucian orthodox scholar attempts a reform; the king, blinded by jealousy, betrays him and thwarts the reform

The neo-Confucian [orthodox faction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarim) took power after the coup. [Jo Gwang-jo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Gwang-jo), a young, energetic reformist, attempted a complete reform of the country according to the Confucian ideal - (a) strengthening the dominance of the Confucian ideology on local levels (b) **land reform** to distribute land more equally (c) inspecting bribes and corruption thoroughly

The reform attempts led by the orthodox faction upset the ""[old merit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungu_(Korean_political_faction))"" faction, though - they were those who supported a powerful adult over a boy king in the section 4. **The orthodox faction viewed the killing of the boy king as an unjustifiable, un-Confucian action.**

* because the boy king, who didn't show any merit, had the oh-so-holy divine blood as the eldest son of the eldest son of... yeah. **The divinity of the unbroken patrilineal lineage** of royals and clans is so central to Confucianism, if you don't know that, you don't understand many traditional East Asian societies. **Only paternal blood matters**. Did Confucius provide a reason why? No, he would just say it was just the way in the ancient Zhou dynasty, the Golden Ages
   * I'm criticizing this because I'm critical of the Korean society that still teaches its patriarchal values as ""tradition."" Confucian values are still taught in 1st-grader ethics classes, I remember. **A lot of social norms Koreans are taught as (holy) ""tradition"" came from the Chinese bronze age, many of which were explicitly written in a very specific set of ancient scripts**, which was blindly upheld to the letter in Joseon period.

&#x200B;

Anyways, now there was faction fighting and legitimacy disputes. The orthodox faction attacked the privilege of the old merit faction.

Jo was very idealistic and uncompromising, and was vastly popular among local Confucian scholars in provinces. However, the old merit faction started framing him that he was planning to be a king himself.

* A famous story:
   * The old merits (conservatives) used honey to write ""Ju (走) Cho (肖) will be King"" **on mulberry leaves so that caterpillars would leave behind the same words** \- so that it would look like a **supernatural sign**. When 走 and 肖 are put together, they form the character 趙 (Jo), the reformist's family name.

The king started getting increasingly anxious about Jo's popularity. After a series of events ([detail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_literati_purges#Third_literati_purge_of_1519)), without telling anyone else, **the king secretly asked the ""old merits"" leaders to kill Jo. Overnight**, they arrested Jo and seven others for treason, they were about to be killed extrajudicially without trial.

But with the War Minister's objection, the execution was delayed until the following morning and the treason was discussed in the cabinet meeting. **The entire court was shocked that Jo was arrested and the king wanted to execute him**. Many of the officials protested (in k-drama, again, they would group-chant ""It is not as it should be, Your Majesty"") - 150 Royal academy students stormed the palace to protest. However, this even more upset the king.

Jo never believed that the king truly betrayed him, and the king commuted the death sentence to exile. However, a month later, he reinstated the death sentence. Before drinking poison, Jo wrote a death poem declaring his loyalty and bowed four times toward the palace.

This whole event is called the [Third Literati Purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_literati_purges#Third_literati_purge_of_1519) (1519). It was widely viewed as a missed opportunity to implement the neo-Confucian ideal in the land of Joseon\*\*.\*\* **Joseon politics would soon degenerate into power struggles among king's in-laws and relatives**

&#x200B;

\*\* I'd also like to point out that an ideal neo-Confucian society (which, again, was based on a 2,500-year-old ancient Zhou social norms) was never fulfilled throughout the Chinese history, where the idea originated from. After 200\~300 years at the maximum, any Chinese dynasty would degenerate into power struggles among [consort kins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consort_kin) and eunuch groups, partially because of the **systematic problems in the agnatic primogeniture and harem system**. When a 8 year old boy becomes a monarch instead of a 35 year old adult, there was usually a problem.

# 8. A 12-year-old boy king succeeds the throne; his mother's brother takes power

After the section 7, a new king was enthroned but he died quickly, and his 12-year-old son succeeded the throne. His mother became the Queen Regent; soon, her brother [Yoon Won-hyung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yun_Won-hyeong) took power.

This might be the point when **the neo-Confucian ideal started getting really degenerated** \- a pattern that's observed in the Chinese history over and over.

Yoon turned into a corrupt tyrant, and massive political in-fights, framing, purges, and massacres ensued. Yoon killed his relatives and many of his opponents.

I wouldn't go into details because it is very complicated and not well-known among the Korean public. You can get into details here: [The Fourth Literati Purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_literati_purges#Fourth_literati_purge_of_1545)

After the chaos of the four literati purges, many neo-Confucian scholars left the court politics - including a revered scholar [Yi Hwang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Hwang). He was famous for his cosmic theory of li (reason) and qi (energy) as two forces that shape the universe.

* Now he's venerated by being on 1,000 won (1 dollar) banknote. I don't know why all these neo-Confucian scholars are on South Korean banknotes, even though Confucianism stopped being the state ideology

When Yoon fell from his power, he commited suicide with his mildly famous second wife [Jeong Nan-jeong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Nan-jeong)

&#x200B;

\*\* [Hwang Jini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Jini) is a famous gisaeng (geisha) and poet who lived in the time of the section 7 and 8

\*\* There's a famous pair of pranksters/high court officials called *Oseong and Haneum*. Most Koreans recognize the names - one story I remember is that *Oseong (or Haneum)*'s parents were upset about his prank, and ordered him to count all the beans piled in their yard. However, clever *Oseong* figured out how to use multiplication. He counted the beans using a bowl and multiplication, finished the task quickly and went out to play

* The actual pranks of the pair are... spicier and weirder than I knew. The pair also had the age gap of about 10 years [https://folkency.nfm.go.kr/en/topic/detail/5920](https://folkency.nfm.go.kr/en/topic/detail/5920)

\*\* There's famous literary siblings (sister and brother) [Heo Nanseolheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heo_Nanseolheon) / [Heo Gyun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heo_Gyun). Nanseolheon (sister) had a literary talent that was recognized by her brother and male relatives. However, **after she got married, her poems got darker, emotional, and more empathetic with women's sufferings** at the time. According to her brother's records, she was in an unhappy marriage and died at the age of 27.

\*\* [Han Seok-bong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Seok-bong) is a famous calligrapher. Most Koreans recognize the name and associate it with the following story: He was talented in calligraphy from the young age, but his family was very poor and couldn't afford the caligraphy tools (ink, inkstick, and inkstone). He practiced on rocks with mountain water. His mother sold rice cakes to support the family. One day, she turned off candlelights at night, and told her son ""practice your calligraphy while I slice rice cakes."" He practiced in darkness, which improved his skill further.

* A bit similar to the story from ancient China about [Mencius' mother](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/01/13/is-extreme-parenting-effective/what-mencius-mother-sought), famous for moving three times to **find an ideal neighborhood to educate her son**.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 9. The largest Literati Purge kills 1,000 court officials and scholars right before the invasion of Japan

**Over time, the scale of literati purges was snowballing**. After the section 8, the Neo-Confucian orthodox faction split into so-called ""Easterners"" and ""Westerners"" - those who opposed to having a new king's brother-in-law (who was a scholar himself) in the court, and those who supported him.

An Easterner went back to his hometown and formed a secret society. It spread across the Southwest province, the historically discriminated former territory of *Baekje* (see my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/x89pzd/koreas_three_kingdom_period_and_unified_silla/))

Soon there was a conspiracy that he was plotting a rebellion. This conspiracy snowballed, and it ultimately resulted in the bloodiest literati purge in Joseon politics. Over 1,000 officials and scholars (Easterners) were executed and expelled

**While everyone was paying attention to this crazy infighting, a real threat was growing overseas - Japan**.

* While China, Korea, and many parts of the world suffered from the expansion of Mongols in the 13th century, Japan remained intact (thanks to [Kamikaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze_(typhoon)), storms that swept Mongol ships). By the time of the end of the 16th century, the unified Japan had developed stronger military, economic, and commercial power compared to Joseon Korea. **They also had muskets** from the trades with the Portuguese.
* [Yi I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_I), a famous scholar in the 16th century (who's on 5,000 won banknote now), had famously claimed that Joseon needed to train [100,000 soldiers](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Yi_I) in case Japan would invade Joseon. This was rejected by other court officials.
   * \* Interestingly, his famous mother [Shin Saimdang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Saimdang) \- painter and writer - is now on 50,000 won banknote lol. She had an exceptional education unlike other women, and moved back and forth between her husband's home and her birth family's home on the beautiful eastern coast ([Ojukheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojukheon)), unlike other women. She was an intelligent and wise mother, and her son Yi I deeply loved and admired her.
* A diplomatic mission called [Tongsinsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon_Tongsinsa#15th%E2%80%9316th_century_diplomatic_ventures) was sent to Japan to congratulate the unification of Japan, and do some intelligence. There's a famous folklore - upon coming back to Joseon, these diplomats said ""Nothing will happen, the Japanese are savages and they can't invade a sophisticated country like us."" More details are found [here](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2546762).
   * It seems that **the Confucian orthodoxy blinded some of these diplomats**.

\*\* the whole post exceeded the text limit, so I divided it into different parts.

&#x200B;

Wow when I started writing this, I didn't expect that this would evolve into this giant monstrously long post. Also, I realize that the whole post reads a bit like ""[History of the Loss of Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Loss_of_Vietnam)"" that was written in 1905. It is said that the book, written by [a Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_B%E1%BB%99i_Ch%C3%A2u) anti-colonial thinker, negatively assessed the Nguyen dynasty turning to **ultra-orthodox conservative Confucianism which led to the failure to modernize**.

This post definitely reads a bit like that. Neo-Confucian orthodoxy (I will later explain what it is) led to Joseon Korea's **five centuries of isolationism and gradual impoverishment** of the nation, which had a violent end in the beginning of the 20th century by annexation to Japan.

This post is comprised of a long introduction on what is neo-Confucianism, and 22 time periods that involve events well-known to the Korean public, which typically involve one or several monarchs.

This post is extremeley long, but I hope one can have an overview of what kind of place Joseon was by just **skimming the section titles and emboldend sentences**.

At the end of the post, I discuss a bit about how the legacy of neo-Confucianism and Joseon still remains in present-day South Korea and North Korea.

The *Goryeo-Joseon* transition at the end of the 14th century occurred smoothly without any large battles, as an aftermath of the Mongol dominance and the decline of Mongol Yuan empire. A new ""retro"" sort of ideology commonly called **Neo-Confucianism** grew in popularity among the aristocratic class.

* The neo-Confucian aristocratic class hated Mongol (considered barbarians), and supported the rising Ming dynasty (Han Chinese dynasty that promoted neo-Confucianism)
* When General Yi Seong-gye disobeyed the last *Goryeo* king's order and brought his army into the capital, it was considered as a Heaven's Mandate. The ruling class of Korea enthroned him as the founder of a new dynasty - Joseon (detail: [in my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xdnht8/goryeo_koreas_medieval_kingdom_918_1392_stories/))

# History of Korea (4) Joseon, the predecessor of modern Korea(s): neo-Confucian orthodoxy and the origin of the hermit kingdom [1392 - 1910] [Part 1]

# 

# 0. Neo-Confucianism

Before going through stories, I'd like to discuss how neo-Confucianism transformed the Joseon society, which is still an important substratum in today's modern Korean societies.

**What's Confucianism?**

* A common answer to this question is that it is an ancient Chinese belief system that emphasizes interpersonal ethics and morality. However, this common understanding does not take into account a fundamental fact that it particularly emphasized **the social norms of the ancient Zhou** (1,046\~771 BC before division) society. In other words, in a fundamental sense, it was a **""retro"" sort of ideology that idealized an ancient, agrarian society**.
   * In the midst of the chaos of Spring and Autumn (770\~476 BC) and Warring States period (476\~221 BC) in China, it seems that there was a common sentiment of **nostalgia towards an idyllic, distant past**, symbolized by two mythical emperors [Yao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao) and [Shun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun), the same way Greeks were nostalgic about a mythical Golden Age.
      * However, different schools of thought in the Spring and Autumn period had different attitudes towards the mythical, idealized past. [Legalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)), which was a dominant school of thought during the Warring States in China, made it clear that the Golden Ages would rarely ever come again because humans are flawed. Legalist [Han Fei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Fei) said:

>(Most rulers are) Mediocre rulers. These mediocre rulers ...  need to hold to the \[universal\] law. If you wait for a Yao or Shun to come, ... it will only be one generation of order in a thousand generations of disorder.

* This line of thought is much closer to the modern Western thoughts, in a sense that it did not romanticize a distant past, and focused on building a system that worked for the present
* Confucianism had a different approach from Legalism. It drew on the nostalgia of the past. The basic idea of Confucius (551\~479 BC) was that **if everyone was civilized and well-mannered following the ancient rites and morality of Zhou** (or the times of mythical Yao and Shun)**, the peace and stability** that had existed in the good old times **would be restored**.
* e.g. **Confucian classics are basically about the rites, poems, histories, and divination mysticism of the ancient Zhou** **(800 BC or before)**. For example
* [Book of Rites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Rites) (or **Rites of Zhou)**: a collection of texts describing the social forms, administration, and ceremonial rites of the Zhou dynasty
* [Classic of Poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Poetry): a collection of ancient poems that date back to the early Zhou period
* [Book of Documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Documents): the history of the mythical era, (mythical) Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties
* [Book of Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) (or **Divination of Zhou** 周易): a synthesis of divination mysticism passed down from the immemorial past (yin/yang - famously [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number#Leibniz_and_the_I_Ching) got the idea of binary mathematics from this book)
* [Etiquette and Ceremonial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_and_Ceremonial): Zhou dynasty social behavior and ceremonial rituals - many rites and rituals regulated women's life, particularly. For example [**three obedience**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Obediences_and_Four_Virtues) **of women**
* Note that these are all knowledge about a society that existed in 1,000\~500 BC, but were used as the core text for scholarly education and civil service exams until the 19th century

\*\* Interestingly, the civil service exam itself was not the product of the Confucian tradition; it was more of a Legalist idea in the beginning

&#x200B;

* Then what was the ideal Zhou society like, in Confucianists' minds? I would say:
   * Back then, land was fairly distributed, farmers and peasants were happy, and tax was low. Farmers barely knew that a king existed. **The younger revered the elders, women obeyed their husbands, children obeyed their parents, and local nobles paid respect to the highest king.** People were well-mannered and did not break proper social norms. Things did not ""deviate"" and everything was in harmony. The time was peaceful. If people are civilized and educated with **proper rites and rituals**, the world will regain harmony again.
* This simple idea was mixed up with various other ancient mysticism such as yin/yang, five elements, [four pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Pillars_of_Destiny) (divination chart that originated from the ancient pyromancy and oracle bone practices), dragon symbolism, etc.
* Plus, the **Confucian spirituality** was centered around **patrilineal ancestor shrines**. The holy rites of Zhou was often referred to as ""t**he laws of spirit tablets**"" (spirit tablets for ancestor patriarchs). Through regular ancestor spirit worship rituals, **the unbroken lineage of paternal bloodline of a clan became divine**. Not being able to continue it was not just the matter of inheritance disputes, but **the matter of a spiritual sin**. This ""laws of spirit tablets"" would become so central to Korean political ideology and spirituality in the Joseon period (**and turn out to be very oppressive to women**).

\*\* Another idea of Confucius was to judge (and thus control) a ruler's behavior by means of history writing. His history book *Spring and Autumn Annals* provided the style and criteria of evaluating a ruler. The Chinese (and Korean) practices of giving a king a ""posthumous temple name"" according to their behaviors, and having an office of historiographers who kept the records of state affairs every day, originated from this.

&#x200B;

**What is neo-Confucianism?**

* Neo-Confucianism is an academic term to describe a later version of Confucianism enhanced with more **self-disciplinary principles and esoteric theologies** influenced by Buddhism and Daoism (e.g. In addition to ""be well-mannered,"" now you were taught to ""have less desires""). This first emerged during the medieval Song dynasty in China (around 12th century AD), synthesized by a scholar named [Zhu Xi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Xi)
* I have limited information on how neo-Confucianism unfolded in China or Vietnam - when I know more, I will add more information.
* However, I know how it unfolded in Joseon Korea. **The 15th century medieval Joseon was a radically different society from the bronze age China in the 10th century BC**. In order to restore the ideal of the Zhou society (that had existed 2,500 years before) envisioned by Confucius, **Koreans went radical and dogmatic in applying the ancient social norms** to the contemporary life in Joseon Korea. For example,
   * e.g. ""[**Mourn for three years when your parents die**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_mourning)**""** \- even the Chinese did not literally abide by this, but Koreans did. There was a political storm caused by this which I will mention later on
   * e.g. ""**Men and women do not sit together after the age 7**"" (source: Rite of Zhou) - this ancient social rule is not even well-known among the Chinese themselves, but Koreans followed it. Most modern Koreans still know this phrase

\*\* In both China and Korea, **the rise of neo-Confucianism tended to go with the** [**harsher oppression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_ancient_and_imperial_China#Ming_dynasty) **of women**

* e.g. **Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant Virtues** ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Fundamental_Bonds_and_Five_Constant_Virtues))
   * This ""principles"" that govern social relationships became central in Neo-Confucianism. Neo-Confucianists believed that humans could become sages through perfecting these relationships and virtues, by practicing proper rites
   * Three bonds:

>The lord is yang, the retainer is yin; the father is yang, the son is yin; the husband is yang, the wife is yin. The way of yin cannot proceed any where on its own.... Therefore, **the retainer depends on his lord to gain merit; the son depends on his father; the wife on her husband**, yin on yang, and the Earth on Heaven.... The Three \[Fundamental Bonds\] of the kingly way can be sought in Heaven

\*\* ""**Men are the Heaven, women are the Earth**"" is a Korean proverb that originated from this idea - any modern Korean person has heard of this phrase

* A neo-Confucian book ""Zhu Xi's Family Rites"" ([link](https://baike.baidu.hk/item/%E5%AE%B6%E7%A6%AE/8239843))  was also widely distributed in Joseon
* Interestingly, the emergence of neo-Confucianism coincided with the emergence of foot-binding practices in China
   * even though this might be just a pure coincidence

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Was Confucianism a bad ideology?**

Confucianism as a political and state ideology is dead in all modern East Asian societies, as monarchy was abolished and no one considered the ancient agrarian Zhou society as an ideal anymore.

The intention of Confucius and Confucianists was not bad. They idealized the Zhou dynasty because they viewed it as more moral than the pre-existing, more ancient [Shang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty) where bloody extravagance and (allegedly) human sacrifice had been performed. They also thought that governance by ""rites and ethics"" was more humane than governance by impersonal law and systems.

Confucianists were concerned about peace, stability, and overall welfare of the society. **Any serious Confucian politician would try to reform land distribution, store grains to give out to poor people in bad times, and lower the taxes for poor people**.

* However, the Confucian ideal was always modelled after a distant past. **Confucian reforms were about the ""restoration"" of the ancient ideal**, not about finding a new, better way to do things.
* For example, Confucian scholars often thought that it is ideal to **restore the ""**[**well-field system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-field_system)**"" that had existed in the 9th century BC**. *Jeong Yak-yong*, a Joseon reformist in the 18th century (explained in section 17), still argued for the restoration of this system.

&#x200B;

In the face of modernism, many Koreans started viewing neo-Confucianism as something **obsolete and oppressive** \- also, a ""wrong"" kind of ideology that significantly weakened *Joseon* in comparison to Japan.

In retrospect, we might think that Confucianism **attributed a wrong factor** to the peace and stability of the early Zhou society. The Zhou society was stable and peaceful ""not because"" the people had the right ethics and social norms, but because it was just lucky in its timing and location. Early-Zhou (bronze age) China did not have a lot of external threats. The **bronze age civilization** was relatively safe and well-protected from the outside world, the same way Egypt was - **only under that condition, a purely agrarian society ruled by ""divine"" rites without military and commercial power** could peacefully exist.

Confucianism also had an idealistic view of human beings (at least **men**) as being [innately good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mencius) or as having a potential to be good. Neo-Confucianists constantly debated about human nature throughout Joseon Korea. This idealistic view, sadly, proved to be incompatible with the advent of the global market economy and the rise of new military powers (Japan, Western powers)

* Compared to this, many dominant Western ideologies view human nature as flawed - in Christianity we are all sinners, and modern economics posit that we all pursue self-interests. This sobering view about human nature tends to require a more impersonal, universal system or principles.

Overall, **the intention behind the idea of Confucianism was good, but idealizing a 2,500 years old bronze age society was essentially anachronistic** \- especially in places like 15th\~19th century Joseon. **Orthodoxy was a problem** in Joseon Korea. Over time, the focus of the Confucian debates in Joseon **moved from the substantial welfare of the people to the literal application of obsolete norms**, which turned out to be unproductive and oppressive.

* Uh... I think we are perhaps seeing... a similar trend in the United States??

\*\* Although Confucianism died as a political ideology, it is still very much alive as a collection of social norms and symbolism in South Korea, and also in North Korea. Even the South Korean flag is based on the [ancient Confucian mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua) (based on a divination book mentioned above)

\*\* There is also an interesting overlap between **Confucianism and communism. A society of happy farmers with equally distributed and communally owned lands** \-- doesn't that sound familiar? That was exactly the ideal of Maoism. ""The agrarian utopia on Earth"" -- to some extent, **the Maoist ideal society was essentially an old Confucian ideal without the scholarly class and monarchy**.

* Both in Confucian and communist regimes, sadly, the agrarian utopias would often come to an ugly end.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**How did neo-Confucianism transform the Joseon society?**

* **Confucian orthodoxy**: The Joseon ruling class set up many Confucian academies and institutions throughout the country, and aimed for the transformation of the whole society based on the Confucian classics written over 2,000 years before.
   * Why this happened is still a bit unclear to me. There was a similar trend in the Ming China (and perhaps Vietnam) - **rejecting foreign, impure influences** (Mongol, nomadic culture, Buddhism, etc) and trying to **go back to the pure Confucian ideal**
   * **Joseon Korea was on steroids** with this, though. Perhaps because of the **much smaller size and ethnic homogeneity** of Korea, the Korean ruling class could implement the retro movement a lot more thoroughly than their Chinese counterpart did
      * In the modern Korean Internet slang, extreme social conservatism is pejoratively called ""Confucian taliban""... for a good reason.
   * The Korean ruling class considered their country as a small China, or even a more successful and purer successor of the ancient Chinese ideology. It was reflected in their cartographic worldview: in this [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnido) made in 1402, **China is at the center of the world, while Korea is the second largest country in the world** right next to it

Impact:

* (1) **Women's status and rights significantly deteriorated**
   * This is one of the most conspicuous social changes commonly associated with the *Joseon* era. Women's status was not as radically low in the previous *Silla and Goryeo* \- *Silla* had several queen rulers.
   * What happened in Joseon is like, with only a little bit of exaggeration, watching the Handmaid's Tale unfolding over 500 years. I made a separate post about this before: [https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/wzqxuu/womens\_oppression\_in\_joseon\_era/](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/wzqxuu/womens_oppression_in_joseon_era/)
      * In a nutshell: **divorce was banned, a widow's remarriage was banned, women had no rights to inherit from her birth family, a woman's duty came to be serving her in-laws and producing a son** (to continue the **divine** unbroken patrilineal lineage of her in-law's clan)**, and patrilineal villages emerged** (brothers, fathers, sons, and male relatives live together while women are exchanged between villages at young ages), and so on - all this made a woman a slave to her husband and in-law family
      * I heard that there's a Chinese proverb ""a woman without talent is virtuous"" - the same idea existed in Korea as well. Plus a woman was taught to ""Obey your father, then your husband, then your son""
* (2) **Filial piety**
   * Filial piety (孝, pronounced as 'hyo' in Korean) is a very important virtue in Confucianism; from the Western point of view, it is often viewed as (unquestioned) **deference and obedience to one's parents** \- that still influences the culture of modern East Asia
   * Somewhere in the Confucian classics it is mentioned ""Mourn for three years when your parents die"" - a renowned neo-Confucianist named Jeong Mong-ju [literally followed this](https://folkency.nfm.go.kr/en/topic/detail/215) by **spending the entire three year living in a shack beside his parents’ graves**. After this, three year mourning became very popular throughout Korea
      * During the war with Japan, some generals and soldiers in the war left the battlefield when they heard the news of the death of their parents to mourn for three years
* (3) **the** [**purge**](https://read.dukeupress.edu/journal-of-korean-studies/article-abstract/22/1/101/166804/Buddhism-during-the-Choson-Dynasty-1392-1910-A?redirectedFrom=fulltext) **of** [**Buddhism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Buddhism#Suppression_under_the_Joseon_Dynasty_(1392%E2%80%931910)) **and shamanism**
   * **Buddhist temples in cities were either closed** or transformed into a Confucian shrine - That's why most Buddhist temples in Korea are now deep in the mountains. **Shamans (mostly female)** were also heavily oppressed and ostracized
      * But many Joseon women preserved their strong faiths in Buddhism and Shamanism - **Confucianism offered spiritual solace only for men in a patrilineal clan**. Women went to Buddhist monks and shamans to pray, confess their problems, and cleanse their souls. Buddhism is still a large religion in Korea (despite the spread of Christianity), and about [50,000 shamanic rituals](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/08/973254913/shamanism-endures-in-both-koreas-but-in-the-north-shamans-risk-arrest-or-worse) are still held each year in Greater Seoul now.
* (4) **Centralization and land reform**
   * In the previous *Goryeo* period, [only 1/3 of administrative units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injong_of_Goryeo) were under the direct control of the central government. The *Joseon* government started sending **magistrate**s who passed the centralized civil service exam to most localities. They wore a special kind of clothes ([image](https://imgur.com/a/11djvLr))
      * There are many folktales where a new magistrate is killed by female ghosts in a new village. There's a theory that they were actually poisoned and killed by old local clans
   * There's an interesting theory that there was [a unbroken chain of slavery](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2022/09/638_289137.html) in Korea for 1,400 years since the time of *Unified Silla*, because the ruling class never changed (comparable to France)
      * While *Joseon* did not abolish slavery, it **abolished ancient slave ghettos** called [hyang/so/bugok](https://www.wikipe.wiki/wiki/ko/%ED%96%A5%C2%B7%EC%86%8C%C2%B7%EB%B6%80%EA%B3%A1). They were most likely villages that had lost the war in ancient warfares (comparable to Japanese [Buraku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burakumin), which still exists).
   * Confucian scholars cared about the **fair distribution of lands**. In the early Joseon period when the society was healthy, land reform was the most important political issue.
* (5) **Anti-commercialism, Isolationism, and anti-militarism**
   * This perhaps was the factor that most heavily influenced the geopolitics of Joseon. Given that Confucianism was basically a retro ideology that idealized an agrarian past, Joseon scholars **put agriculture (rice farming) on a pedestal, while discouraging trades and commercial activities**
      * [Confucian hierarchy of occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_occupations): **Scholars > Farmers > Craftsmen > Merchants** \>>> Slaves
      * The legacy of this is still alive - for example, blue collar technicians in South Korea are still heavily looked down upon compared to college graduates
   * **Isolationism** \- Joseon kept only [one port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busan) open for Japanese traders. There was still a little [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Korea#Decree_against_the_Huihui_community) merchant community by the beginning of the 15th century, but they were forced to abandon their headgear and close their mosques. This contrasts with the previous *Silla* and *Goryeo* period where the ruling class engaged in international trades more actively
      * The domestic trades were also not active - the government collected taxes in the form of agricultural produces and regional specialties, instead of coins. In other words, the economy was largely a barter economy. **The anti-commercial and frugal taste of the ruling class** was reflected on cultural products - the porcelains became [simply white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon_white_porcelain), often without any decorations <> in contrast to much more sophisticated [Goryeo wares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goryeo_ware)*.* *Goryeo* used to export *Goryeo wares* to China and other countries, but more crude Joseon porcelains lost markets.
      * **The clothes were white** **without any color or decorations** for both upper class and commoners
      * The influence of anti-commercialism was limited in Ming China because the Chinese economy was already way too large, and silver was pouring in from, for example, Portugal. However, the anti-commercialism and isolationism **effectively impoverished the nation**
   * Lastly, anti-militarism. Confucianism (and thus Joseon) idealized an ancient agrarian society in the 10th century BC **when there was no external threats** such as powerful nomadic groups or Japan. The Chinese Emperor [Wen of Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wen_of_Han) dynasty (in the 2nd century BC) was praised for levying only 2\~3% of tax on the population, but it was only possible in an ancient time before the rise of nomadic military powers and later, the West and Japan
      * However, based on the Confucian orthodox, the Joseon scholarly ruling class paid little attention to military organizations or intelligence on other nations, only focusing on internal affairs, royal succession, and ""rites."" Even after the devastating experience with Mongols. **This effectively rendered the country powerless when Japan successfully modernized**
      * The same trend occurred in Ming China as well - resulting in them being easily conquered by Manchus (former Jurchens) later on. [This book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Loss_of_Vietnam) says that the same trend existed in Vietnam too.

&#x200B;

Overall, neo-Confucianism as a retro ideology dominated the Joseon society for 500 years, and its legacy still lingers on. Many Koreans believe that this laid the foundation for the **social conservatism and patriarchy** that's still deep-rooted in South Korea, and **isolationism and three generations of patrilineal succession** in North Korea.

* I'm not saying patriarchy doesn't exist in other countries (including the West), but for example, South Korea has the largest gender gap in income among the OECD countries.
* **Samsung Lee family and North Korean Kim family still follow the same pattern of succession** \- [agnatic primogeniture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture#Agnatic_primogeniture) \- the eldest son inherits no matter what, and female/maternal lines are ignored. The Japanese (also Roman) way of taking a competent man into the family as a son-in-law is unheard, and unthinkable. **Paternal blood is the most important**.

\-------------------

Oh well this was a very long intro, lol. The history of the Joseon is extremely well documented, but many materials are still only available in Korean.

In this series of post, I'll introduce the 500 years of Joseon history at a level that most Koreans are familiar with. The whole post got crazy long so I had divide it, but still this is not that much deep. I divided the history into **5 phases and 22 time periods** that involve a major event or monarch. Most Koreans are familiar with the way I described Phase 1\~4. I went a lot deeper in the Phase 5 (the last phase before the annexation to Japan), and provide a little bit different interpretation than what most Koreans are familiar with, especially with regards to the role of the last queen Myeongseong.

* This post is very monarch-centered because that's how the [Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veritable_Records_of_the_Joseon_Dynasty) was written, the main source of what we know about Joseon. **Many Koreans know a lot about Joseon kings and their stories**. Interestingly, however, I heard that North Koreans do not teach people about the history of monarchs. They instead focus on generals, folk heroes and artists.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

There’s a famous “roundel” that depicts John 2 Komnenos in the Dumbarton Oaks museum. For me this comes close towards a more sculptured depiction of a byzantine emperor. Of course there’s also the amazing ivory works during the Macedonian era, which really shows the skill of artists in this era.

As siege warfare is quite often a form of mass mobilization warfare and total war, one would expect that in some cases economic inequality between rich and poor would level.Scheidel gives some examples of how sieges may contribute to leveling social inequality, but does not extend too much on the topic. 

Do any of you know some examples of sieges where Scheidels phenomena could be applied to (even if it is in a very minor form)? Or do you rather think that the these does not really apply to roman siege warfare? I have strong believes that it does, but could not find any convincing examples...

298,Historical factors in the 1950s and 60s that made the Cuban revolution and its leaders(Castro and Che) popular in the developing world that I think should be appreciated more.,16,y0nrhy,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/y0nrhy/historical_factors_in_the_1950s_and_60s_that_made/,14,"The Cuban revolution was a significant event in the 20th century and one that propelled its leaders, Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, to become iconic political figures in the 20th century. Their reception varied depending on the context they were viewed in. In an American context they were viewed negatively due to the association with communism and authoritarianism. In the developing world though at the time, it was widely different. They were admired as revolutionary leaders and these are historical factors. These factors will include both the context as well as historical precursors that could have shaped global perceptions in the developing world of the Cuban revolution in the 1950s and 60s.

**(i)Post War decolonisation and Che Guevara's internationalism**

* When the Cuban revolution started out Castro and many of his compatriots were nationalists. They were focused on specific issues in Cuba and they drew inspiration from historical Cuban nationalist figures such as Jose Marti and Carlos Manuel Cespedes. Now even with this specifically nationalist focus the revolution was famous enough.
* Che Guevara's presence in the ranks of the Cuban revolutionaries was important in terms of bring an internationalist perspective. Which isn't that surprising. The Argentine who on his motorcycle travelled all of Latin American, landed in Guatemala when the CIA coup was taking place, and then landed in Mexico to meet Castro. Che brought an ideological internationalism to a revolution that had a nationalist start. And you could see this in the roles that he played. He was one of the founding fathers of Cuba's Medical Internationalism. He was a key diplomat who was important in forging the revolutionary government's diplomatic ties both with the Eastern Bloc as well as many of the Non Aligned countries of the third world as well as revolutionary movements.
* Che's internationalism happen to take place at the same time that you had post war decolonisation movements. The Egyptian revolution of the 50s under Nasser. The Algerian revolution of the 50s and 60s with Ahmed Ben Bella. The independence movement of the Congo, etc. Che's internationalism formed if you will a bridge between the Cuban revolution and the anti colonial movements at the time. And this is symbolised in Che's speech in Algeria in 1965.

**(ii)The Bay of Pigs and the context of CIA coups in the developing world**

* Another reason for the Cuban revolution's popularity in the developing world was the victory at the Bay of Pigs. The historical context for this being significant are the CIA coups of the 50s and 60s. When you place the coups in Iran(53) Guatemala(54) Congo(60) and other attempted coups such as Indonesia in the background of the Bay of Pigs it becomes obvious why many in the developing world at the time would view this as an inspiration because it ended up symbolising a type of defiant self determination. 

**(iii)The Cuban revolution and the background of Latin American independence leaders**

* I had hinted at before the role of Cuba's independence leaders like Cespedes and Jose Marti in terms of inspiring the nationalist element of the Cuban revolution. I also think that the memory of Latin America's independence was what inspired its popularity throughout Latin America. Figures such as Simon Bolivar and Jose San Martin's story of fighting an anti colonial war of independence throughout Latin America would have had some similarities with the story of Castro and Che in the minds of some Latin Americans. Especially Che Guevara's story of the Argentine who journey's North, mirroring Jose San Martin in his meeting with Simon Bolivar. 

**(iv)The Cuban Revolution and the Anti Apartheid Movement**

* The Cuban revolution had a major inspiration on the Anti Apartheid movement of the 20th century. In the 1960s when the ANC was forming its military wing they took as an inspiration for their military doctrines Che Guevara's manual on Guerilla War. When Nelson Mandela made his ""I am prepared to Die"" speech he states explicitly it was partly inspired by Castro's ""History will Absolve Me"" speech. And then there was the military assistance Cuba gave during the Cold War. This of course amplified the Cuban revolution's popularity in Africa. 

You combine this with both the military and medical internationalism of the Cuban government during the Cold War and it explains its popularity.",1665430394.0,2022-10-10 19:33:14+00:00

The biggest armies in this crusade were from Toulouse, Normandy and the Holy Roman Empire. So, my question is if this campaign took away France's and HRE's ability to raise armies. I get that at this point feudalism was more present in Europe, so kings had less power and this ability were already reduced, but did the 1st crusade make the situation worse in this capacity?

If yes, did later crusades alter this burden a lot or, when England got more invested, did Richard the LionHeart's higher taxes help England escape this high burden.

I imagine that if this burden was similar for the major european powers, then western Europe might have been better, peace-wise, at those epochs.",1665143762.0,2022-10-07 11:56:02+00:00

There are also other examples from other cultures of attacking the homeland and an aggressor, and retreating without bothering to occupy the territory. This generally satisfies the desire for revenge, and reduces the ability of those attacked to be a nuisance later on.

Why didn't the late Roman Empire host retaliatory excursions against the Germanic tribes, the Huns, and others who invaded their lands?",1665111639.0,2022-10-07 03:00:39+00:00

But for the early years of his leadership, Baldwin was of questionable talent as a leader. Stanley Baldwin was popular enough to command enormous majorities at the ballot box by the mid-1930s, but he forced a hung parliament in 1923 when an election was arguably unnecessary (allowing for the first Labour Government) and again in 1929. Many political parties have lost their position for far less than this. It seems that he should have lost his mandate in 1923, as most leaders would have.

308,Where did the English language REALLY come from?,140,xwxaqx,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xwxaqx/where_did_the_english_language_really_come_from/,146,"In recent decades, the idea that there was never an Anglo-Saxon invasion, or even a migration, has become increasingly popular. Archaeologists like Francis Pryor and Susan Oosthuizen point out that there is zero archaeological evidence to support the idea of an invasion, and in fact all the evidence currently available suggests a great deal of continuity in the lifestyles of the early medieval Britons, and that the English identity emerged organically over centuries of exposure to and trade with other North Sea peoples as Britain shifted away from being on the fringes of a Mediterranean trade network, and ended up center stage of a North Sea trade network. Basically that the Britons became the English because it was more fashionable at the time to do so. Their arguments are very compelling, and even offer fascinating reinterpretations of the written history of the period that suggest that Bede invented the idea of an English people not as an ethnic group, but as a sort of code for ""Catholic Britons"" as opposed to the ""Celtic Christian Britons"" who had all the same beliefs (more or less), but didn't report to the Pope in Rome (which makes it so much more ironic that the English were the ones who would eventually abandon Catholicism and the Irish would uphold it throughout the Protestant Reformation). 

What I cannot wrap my head around though is the linguistic side of things. Let's assume this theory is correct, and that there never was an invasion or mass migration of Germanic peoples to the British Isles in the early medieval period. In that case, how the hell did a new Germanic language spring up on an island that had previously only spoken variations of Latin and Celtic? How or why did these groups of people invent a language that belonged to a totally different language family, wildly unrelated to the languages previously spoken? I can't think of any other instance in history where that occurred without some sort of coercion or influx of settlers. It would be like if Afrikaans emerged in South Africa without there being any influx of Dutch or British settlers. Or if the Japanese had invented and then adopted a totally new Romance language after meeting Portuguese merchants for the first time. Even Swahili, which is probably the closest analogy, is still a Bantu language, even though it borrows heavily from Arabic.

So IF there was no Anglo Saxon migration, then where did the English language come from and why is it so vastly different from Latin and Celtic?

https://vimeo.com/425282049

EDIT: After reading a bunch of these comments, I'd like to reframe my question. If the migration DID happen in some form or another, then why is there so little archaeological evidence to support it? If enough people were migrating into Britain to change the linguistic and genetic makeup as much as it seems they did, then why is there so little evidence as to cast doubt on it in the first place?

&#x200B;

* Primordial bronze age civilization before the ""moralization"" of the Chinese civilization 
   * Many of its bronze artifacts look kind of Latin American - **abstract, intimidating, a little bit crude**. Probably this was the time when a small number of ruling families, for the first time, started exerting absolute power over the vast majority of people (including slaves captured from wars) based on technology and weaponry. The aesthetics of many artifacts focus on the sheer display of power (scary faces, for example) 
   * An archetypal Shang bronze artifact: a **bronze ritual vessel** [https://imgur.com/a/l0L0t22](https://imgur.com/a/l0L0t22)
   * There's also many pop theories about **human sacrifice** during the Shang dynasty. Some historians' work seem to support that such rituals had indeed happened (in the form of the execution of slaves or war prisoners) ([link](https://sites.psu.edu/kerenw/2015/05/27/historical-background-of-human-sacrifices-during-shang-dynasty/))  

\*\* In the following Zhou dynasty, the display of power is a lot more moderated by sophistication and moral virtues. Human sacrifice disappeared, even though the practice of burying slaves alive with a dead ruler lasted until later period. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Primitive writing - pyromancy, divination, and oracle bones 
   * **Oracle bones** ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone)) are another fascinating artifacts. The origin of the Chinese characters is very mystical - ""oracle bone scripts"", a form of early logogram (similar to hieroglyphs), were **carved on turtle shells and ox bones that were used in divination** 
      * The divination process (pyromancy): ""Divination questions were carved onto the bone or shell in oracle bone script using a sharp tool. Intense heat was then applied with a metal rod until the bone or shell cracked due to thermal expansion. **The diviner would then interpret the pattern of cracks** and write the prognostication upon the piece as well"" 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Archeological discovery - I think this is a beautiful story on its own! 
   * The 19th century: **the oracle bones were used as medicine by local farmers** (in the old Shang territory) who discovered them from ground. 
   * 1899: a Chinese scholar named [Wang Yi-rong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone#Discovery) (influenced by the ""evidential scholarship"" in the Qing dynasty which was again influenced by Western science) **first recognized that oracle bone scripts might be a very ancient predecessor** of the Chinese characters 
      * News of the discovery of the oracle bones created a market for them among antiques collectors, and led to multiple waves of illegal digs over several decades 
   * 1910: The source of the oracle bones was eventually traced to a village - different scholars **hypothesized that that place might be the capital of the mythical Shang dynasty** 
   * 1917: A scholar named Wang Guowei **deciphered the oracle bone inscriptions of the names of the Shang kings and constructed a complete Shang genealogy** (which matched with the existing ancient historiography) 
   * 1928-37: The first archeological excavations of the hypothetical [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinxu) of the Shang dynasty were led by an archeologist named Li Ji, known as the father of Chinese archeology. The team uncovered **the remains of a royal palace, royal tombs, and more than 100,000 oracle bones** 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* The Yellow River civilization was more **lush and had exotic animals such as rhinoceros and elephants** 
   * This is similar to what happened in the Sahara - the **ecological change**. There is a book titled ""The Retreat of the Elephants: An Environmental History of China"" 
   * There are **bronze artifacts of elephants and rhinoceros** 
      * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephants\_in\_ancient\_China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephants_in_ancient_China)
      * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceroses\_in\_ancient\_China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceroses_in_ancient_China)
   * The Classic of Poetry is a Confucian classic, and a compilation of ancient poems that had been orally transmitted. One of the poems is: 

>And go to the hall of our prince,  
>  
>There raise the **cup of rhinoceros horn**,  
>  
>And wish him long life, - that he may live for ever.

\*\* **The ancient stories and poems of China are full of exotic plants, animals and tribes** \- because the Southern part of the Chinese landmass was covered with forests, and non-Han ethnic people in tribal societies lived there. 

\*\* The Verses of Chu ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu\_Ci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_Ci)) is also a fascinating collection of songs from a Southern state of Chu (1,030\~223 BC), which was a mixture of Han Chinese migrants and various ethnic tribes 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* ""**Pond of wine, forest of meat**"": The demise of the Shang dynasty and Shang-Zhou transition 
   * The legend has it that the last king of Shang and his ""beautiful yet wicked"" wife Daji were corrupt, tyrannical and even sadistic 
   * They had a pond filled with wine, and a forest full of hanging roasted meat in their garden. **Naked women and men chased each other in an orgiastic fashion**. The famous idiom ""Pond of Wine, Forest of Meat"" comes from a later ""Records of the Grand Historian"" (written in 91 BC) 
   * The people of Shang revolted eventually, and a new [Zhou dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty) was established (also known as Yin-Zhou revolution) (There's a whole Japanese manga about it - [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoshin_Engi) lol) 
      * The new Zhou dynasty had more modest and moralistic culture, which would influence the later Chinese dynasties for a very long time. They established a **strict primogeniture** (father-son succession) system that had not been the case during the Shang dynasty. 
      * **The house of Shang survived** though. Some of them revolted after the fall of their dynasty, but others were granted land. [The state of Song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_(state)) was ruled by the Shang descendants as a vassal state of Zhou. There was more brother-to-brother succession of the throne in the state of Song, compared to other Zhou states.

While it didn't use the same racial system as the Atlantic Slave Trade, and people of many ethnicities could be enslaved, we can't just give no for an answer.

*Disclaimer: I'm talking about the Indian Ocean world BEFORE European exploration/colonization started there circa 1500. I haven't researched anything after that. There was a boom in the Indian Ocean slave trade around 1900 when the Atlantic trade was banned. My knowledge is between 900-1450 AD, the heyday of maritime trade between Africa, Middle East, India, Indonesia and China.*

**SHORT ANSWER TL;DR**

The Atlantic slave trade was very clear cut. One drop and you're black (thus subhuman and legally discriminated against) and you're a slave unless your master frees you. Even then you're still legally black. **There was no one drop rule in Asia, and race was not a legal status all by itself. BUT! There is a persistent historical association between slavery and blackness, and prejudice towards black Africans.** Africa was the main source of people who became commodities on the global maritime market in the Indian Ocean.

&#x200B;

**LONG ANSWER** (see bottom of post for a paragraph sketching the time period if you want context)

THE BASICS OF THE SLAVE TRADE

Slavery was common within all these societies and most slaves were owned by someone of the same ethnicity as them. But when speaking of a slave trade, it's mostly African. Many parts of Africa could be raided for slaves with impunity, unheard of for India or Oman. Sometimes a local leader would sell people from his realm, or poor parents would sell a child. Other people just got kidnapped--by foreigners or a neighboring nation. A non African person could of course be kidnapped by pirates and sold, or sold by her family.  But there wasn't the same kind of steady stream of people shipped all over the way there was for Africa. 

Most slaves in this trade were women and children, with women becoming domestic workers or concubines. Agriculture was not based on the slave trade. It was more of a luxury to have a slave than an economic necessity. The exception to this is the Zanj slave revolt in Iraq 869-883. Large numbers of African slaves, supported by other low ranking members of society, rose up after being forced to do backbreaking work converting salt marshes into farmland. Zanj is an Arabic word for African, which also can mean slave. It was one of the largest and most successful slave revolts in history, with a multi ethnic rebel coalition ruling much of Iraq for decades.

Islam reformed slavery and made it more humane. The Quran frequently encourages people to free their slaves and to treat them kindly. It stresses that no person is superior to the other aside from their moral character. Muslims freed their slaves far more often than Europeans did. Islamic custom declared an enslaved woman who gave birth to her master's child was set free. It was also customary for a master to release all his slaves when he died. Children of slaves were not slaves themselves. Slaves could be educated, and some became high ranking government officials! Paradoxically, many people might have looked down on Africans and also got bossed around by one. There is even an empire in India founded by a slave. Some historians say an unintended consequence of Muslim reforms was to encourage raiding for new slaves, rather than building up a large population of slaves at home. It was against Islamic law to enslave another Muslim, though many people chose to ignore this.

Muslims saw each other as part of one community that transcended wealth and ethnic ties. Muslims of all colors went on the same pilgrimage, and would offer each other hospitality during travel. Arabic became a unifying language spoken everywhere there were Muslims. 

&#x200B;

PERCEPTIONS OF BLACKNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 800-1400 CE

The Arabic word *abeed* means slave, and today is still used as a synonym for black (it's a slur). You can find racist descriptions in the writing of scholars and travelers from the time-- all the way back to Galen (Roman Empire) who wrote that black men were sexually insatiable. 

* In the Hadhramaut-- a desert on the coast of Syria-- slaves and freed slaves had to live in a ghetto on the outskirts of town. Freed black slaves in Syria were often stuck doing domestic work, so many of them went to sea, mostly settling in Southeast Asia. The only people lower than them were the descendants of Ethiopians who had invaded Arabia before Islam. Merchants came from the highest class of people in this society, the siyyids. Siyyids settled heavily abroad and married foreign women, but would only let their daughters marry other siyyids. The mixed children and grandchildren of these marriages were called *muwallad*. Some people in the siyyid ex pat community were prejudiced against muwallad, reflecting their anxiety about preserving Hadhrami culture while living somewhere else.
* Black Iraqis and Iranians today have a long history of discrimination, living in ghettos, restricted to lowly professions, and being told ""don't marry my daughter."" Their culture is still distinct from the dominant national culture and their heritage is excluded from the national narrative. Iranian theater has a history of blackface, which has many parallels to minstrel shows in the United States.

However, ethnic lines were not as clearly drawn back then (900-1400). Many people who would have been black by European standards identified as Arab because that was their culture. Wealth, religion and connections were often way more important than what you looked like. In Hindu law on the coast of India, all foreign merchants were ""impure"" according to the caste system and lumped together. They had to live together in a certain part of the port city (which is what the foreigners preferred anyway!)

On the East Coast of Africa, or the Swahili Coast, a hybrid culture formed between Africans and foreign merchants, mostly from Oman, Syria and Iran. The monsoon season meant you had to wait several months for the winds to change, so the merchants would bide their time in Africa and get to know people there. Parts of the Swahili Coast (East Africa between the Horn and next to Madagascar) were ruled by Muslims from Shiraz (Iran) and Oman at times, and local Africans had a lower status than people of mixed Arab and African descent.

&#x200B;

OTHER KINDS OF SERVITUDE IN ASIA 

**But most societies enslaved ""their own people,"" right?** Yes, but the line between a slave and a servant was blurry and had variations in different places. Before buying a slave from Africa was possible, the wealthy had longstanding traditions of relying on people to fulfill their whims and impunity in how they treated them. I remember the biography of Virginia Woolf remarked that before modern appliances, having servants was considered essential for having a comfortable life. Not unique to England.

Concubines and maids in China were bought at a market with money and vulnerable to abuse and stigma. But you became a concubine when you or your parents signed a contract. It could happen to anybody, though an upright man would be horrified if he found out his new concubine came from a noble family and might let her go or even set up a proper marriage for her. Ordinary maids in China had contracts and would seek a new employer when their term of service was up. 

In India, the Brahmins and military leaders had plantations worked by serfs, bound to the land. These serfs were local people. 

In Arabia, both before and after Muhammad, you could become a slave if you got into debt or were captured in war. But you could also buy your way out. 

&#x200B;

**SKETCH OF THE TIME PERIOD** 

So the whole coast of the Indian Ocean is engaged in constant trade, cramming multiple voyages every year thanks to the predictable monsoon winds. Madagascar, East Coast of Africa, Oman, Yemen, Iran, India, Indonesia, China and even Australia are involved. **The heyday of the trade is roughly 900-1450 AD.** Keep in mind that it was going on at least since the Roman Empire complained about spending all its silver on India's goods. Also remember there's a healthy overland trade as well, to bring the stuff from the ships to people living inland.

There's a cosmopolitan coastal culture that is separate from the inland cultures, but melded all the continents together. If a city was a center of trade, it was home to THOUSANDS of merchants from all over the world and closely connected to other cities like it. (Keep in mind the world had way fewer people back then). It was common for sailors to have wives and children on multiple continents! Ordinary people ate exotic food and the rich enjoyed luxuries from around the world. Not many ethnically Chinese merchants actually sailed for most of this period because the central government restricted trade, though Chinese goods were everywhere. Foreigners living in China often handled most of the trade.

347,The origin of age-set/generational social structures,603,xm6ofc,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xm6ofc/the_origin_of_agesetgenerational_social_structures/,14,"Been doing some reading into Ethiopian ethnicities and cultures and discovered the “gadaa” system of the Oromo. Essentially it’s the structuring of society to into a constantly renewing male age-set social class system that progresses from (to crudely put it) in a boyhood-adolescence-warrior-elder cycle. There’s more sets than the ones I have stated (I think 10) and each is generally 8 years in range. 

The following sources discuss the systems and some discuss their origin:

- https://www.britannica.com/topic/age-set
-https://www.academia.edu/64954380/The_origins_of_the_Borana_gada_system

The second source discusses generation set systems and their characteristics. Systems where society is structured into generations, which can end up having kids and old men lumped into the same set, can be troublesome. It can thus be inferred that there seems to be a developmental ‘trend’ towards what the writer calls “true” age set systems in society’s where such systems of societal organization occurs. Or at least, they might be better long term. 

My question would be what causes the development of such systems in the first place? Are they co-existent with ‘normal’ material status structures? What are the socio-historical factors influencing the creation of such systems?",1663960987.0,2022-09-23 19:23:07+00:00

Conversely, a time of prolonged peace would lead to fragmentation and weaker governments.

I've seen some evidence for this idea in Walter Scheidel's books, The Fall of Rome, and The Great Leveler. But I wonder to what extend is it a consistent trend in history? How much of centralization was actually driven by outside pressure vs other factors?",1663970066.0,2022-09-23 21:54:26+00:00

In population, territory, and even annual revenue everything seemed to be improving relatively speaking.

Yet, following Manzikert, it seems massive gains were made into the country by the Seljuks and other states. (Correct me if I’m wrong)

1. Was Manzikert the climactic battle akin in which the fate of the Empire was decided or was it simply exposing a house of cards as the foundation for resurgence was built on unsteady growth? 

2. What was the current political situation like domestically and externally beyond? I believe it was tenuous but… I might be downplaying it’s importance.

3. Did the empire’s military never recover from this? Or was it mismanagement, corruption and other foreign invasion that prevented recovery?",1663881939.0,2022-09-22 21:25:39+00:00
353,How Many Ocean Capable Commercial Ships Sank Before the 19th Century?,743,xl20ju,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xl20ju/how_many_ocean_capable_commercial_ships_sank/,135,"I  am wondering how often ships were lost in the age of sailing and  slave-rowing with wooden ships. Was there a development to less losses  over time due to better ships, or did wooden ships sink alike in the  Roman times as well as during the 15th century? And generally, how many  ships used to be there, and what was the quota of loss annually?

My  guess would be that there was around one ocean capable commercial (aka  cargo) ship per 10,000 people. With 10 million people on average living  in the greater area of the Mediterranean Sea, who had a more or less  direct access to a harbor and sea trade, that would result in 1,000  commercial ships at a given time.

If  you now assume a loss of 1%, that would result in 10 ships lost every  year. Multiplied with 2,000 years (including gaps for periods of  civilization break-down) that would mean there must be around 20,000  ship wrecks lying scattered on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea.

With 2.5 million km² of space, the Mediterranean Sea, there should be  one wreck every 125 km² or 11x11km.

Is that around correct, or are the numbers and relations differently?",1663854769.0,2022-09-22 13:52:49+00:00

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome.

By ""ancient sources"", I mean something beyond citing a modern history book, which cites another modern historical author, who cites another.  What I'm trying to locate is an ancient text that identifies the year in which this event took place, either putting a number to it, or referencing something else that can be numerically dated.  Multiple sources would be even better.

I understand Josephus was an eyewitness but I'm unclear on whether he actually states the year in which these events took place.  Does anyone know if the date of 70 CE is flatly stated somewhere, possibly in any records of the actions of Titus (who led the siege), or is it rather a computed date based on other known dates?

History of Korea (3) **Goryeo** \[918 \~ 1392\] - often forgotten medieval kingdom

&#x200B;

1. **Later Three Kingdoms** \[889 \~ 935\]

With the collapse of the Silla dynasty (in accordance with the collapse of Tang dynasty and their international economic and political systems), **powerful local clans and warlords** called 'hojok' with their own land and soldiers emerged. Some of them claimed **reviving the old kingdoms** of Goguryeo and Baekje that had existed in the Three Kingdoms era. This era is called [Later Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Later_Three_Kingdoms)era, and lasted for about 50 years

* [Gung ye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gung_Ye) \- He's a **one-eyed Buddhist monk** who founded Later Goguryeo and became psychotic later. In popular culture, it is believed that he claimed to have clairvoyance. There was a popular 2000 period drama about this period, and he's **still a popular meme** in Korea....
   * Legend says it that he was born in the royal family of Silla, but the royal fortuneteller said that the baby will bring disasters to the kingdom. The king ordered to kill the baby, but the mother had her maid to escape with the baby. In the process the maid accidentally poked the baby's eye. The cursed prince became a Buddhist monk later on
* [Gyeon Hwon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeon_Hwon) \- The founder of Later Baekje. He's always depicted as a man of dubious morality in history books, but historians point out that that might be the bias of winners. There's a legend that his mother gave birth to him after having a sexual contact with a worm disguised as a man.
   * His father Ajagae was a peasant and led a local peasant revolt.
* [Gyeongsun of Silla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongsun_of_Silla) \- The last king of Silla. He was a puppet king enthroned by *Gyeon Hwon*

&#x200B;

Then *Gung Ye*, the monk-king of *Later Gugoryeo*, **went psychotic**, referred to himself as [Maitreya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitreya) Buddha, **killed his own wife and children** as well as many other people. He lost support from the public, got eventually killed. The rebels crowned ***Wang Geon***, one of his trusted generals

* [Wang Geon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taejo_of_Goryeo) was a descendant of a powerful maritime merchant clan in Northern Korea. After being crowned, he renamed his kingdom ***Goryeo***, led successful military campaigns, had *Silla* surrender, and eventually overthrew *Later Baekje*, **unify**ing the country again.
   * [Maui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prince_Maui), the Crown Prince of *Silla*, became a hermit Buddhist monk, and spent his whole life wearing *Maui* (hemp linen clothes) as if in a funeral

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2. **The founder of** ***Goryeo*** **and his son** \[918 \~ 975\]

Wang Geon, the founder of *Goryeo*, allied with *hojok*s (powerful local clans) through marriage. He married **30 noble women** from these clans, and had **34 children**. Uhh outside this fecundity, he also left **10 injunctions** for the next generation kings, which allows us to peek into the belief system at that time

(two English sources I found: [first](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/ps/korea/ten_injunctions.pdf) and [second](https://new-docs-thumbs.oneclass.com/doc_thumbnails/new_mobile/1821735-textbook-notes-us-ucla-korea-50-textbookwanggeon'steninjunctions&developmentofconfucianpolityi.jpg))

\[10 Injunctions from Wang Geon\]

* (1) Success of the state depends on the favor and **protection of Buddha** \- Build temples.
* (2) Temples & monasteries should be built upon the sites chosen by Monk [Doseon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doseon) according to the principle of **feng shui**
* (3) **Succession by the eldest son** will be the most legitimate, unless the eldest son is unworthy
* (4) We **do not need to copy the Chinese way** \- ""our country is geographically and culturally different from China"" - and **never copy Khitan** (Mongolic nomads), they're savages.
   * This contrasts to the later Joseon dynasty (1392-1897) that was founded on the Chinese neo-Confucian ideology
* (5) I have achieved the great task of founding the dynasty with the help of the elements of **mountain and river of our country** (he's talking about feng shui). (While the capital of the new dynasty is his hometown K[aesong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaesong)), **Pyongyang** is the Western Capital located in an auspicious site. Make a royal visit to Pyongyang four times a year, and reside there for more than a hundred days a year. That will ensure peace and prosperity
   * Pyongyang is one of the most ancient cities in the Korean peninsula. It's such a pity that the city was destroyed so badly during the Korean War, and now we can't go there
* (6) **Buddhist lantern festival** ([Yeondeung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeondeunghoe)), and the Palgwan Festival that **worships the spirits of our mountains and rivers and the dragon god** are very important, and should never be abolished in the future
   * The Buddhist lantern festival is still vibrant in Korea. The mountain spirit/dragon god festival was abandoned in the later Joseon dynasty.
* (7) Win the hearts of the people - lighten the burden of taxation.
* (8) The regions south of Gongju (**the old territory of Baekje**) is treacherous & disharmonious. **Do not let the people from there participate** in the government & do not intermarry with them.
   * Some say that this is the first traceable record of **anti-Jeolla** s[entiment](https://brownpoliticalreview.org/2022/05/regionalism-in-south-korea/) that's still vivid today, which is a type of severe **regional discrimination** (or I'd say micro-racism) against people from the modern-day Jeolla province (which is the old territory of Baekje, even though this fact might or might not be important)
* (9) Do not change salaries for aristocrats & bureaucrats. Treat soldiers kindly & lighten their burden.
* (10) Read widely in the classics and history, and avert mistakes taking the past as a warning for the present.

&#x200B;

One of the founder's numerous sons became the fourth king of Goryeo,

[Gwangjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangjong_of_Goryeo):

* He did foundational works for the new dynasty. Fun fact: realizing that he had too many brothers and step-moms from powerful clans, he tried to consolidate power and concentrate the royal blood by marrying his **half-sister**, and later, **half-niece**.
* He tried to **abolish slavery**, and establish the (Chinese-style) **civil service exam** to promote meritocracy. He also declared that Goryeo was an Empire and he himself was an Emperor, which Korean dynasties didn't usually do in order not to provoke China. He temporarily used Goryeo's own era names, instead of [Chinese ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_era_name).
   * Slavery revived after his attempts, and the civil service exam degenerated into some distorted form of the system of hereditary privilege, though
* Later he got paranoid, and **killed a lot of his relatives**, including a brother, and his father's in-law families. He suffered from nightmares later on, and died at the age of 50. Being a monarch must not be an easy thing.
* His son from the marriage with his half-sister became the [next king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongjong_of_Goryeo) \- he avoided politics and royalty, and hung out with commoners. Shortly after this guy's cousin became the [next king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seongjong_of_Goryeo), who adopted Confucian political principles suggested by a [descendant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choe_Seungno) of the Silla aristocracy
   * The Confucian suggestions are called ""Simu 28 injunctions""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3. **Prior to the Mongol Invasion** \[918 \~ 1231\]

There was a nomad para-Mongolic group called [Khitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_people) north of the Korean peninsula, which founded the Liao [dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_dynasty). (The group that the founder of Goryeo disdained in his 10 Injunctions) Goryeo had frequent military conflicts with them. Three stories are famous among modern Koreans:

* The founder of *Goryeo* disliked Khitan so much that when the Khitan king sent him [50 camels](https://www.taekwondopreschool.com/history_koryo.html) as a gift, he tied up all the camels to a bridge and starved them to death
* [Seo Hui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seo_Hui), a *Goryeo* diplomat, led 60,000 Khitan troops to withdraw, without battles \[993\]
* [Gang Gam-chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_Gam-chan)'s military victory over the Khitan army \[1019\]
   * Using classical tactics of cutting the Khitan army's supplies and attacking them in the middle of retreat, General *Gang Gam-chan* annihilated 90,000 Khitan soldiers with a lot fewer casualties on Goryeo side. This is considered **one of the three greatest military victories** in Korean history
      * the other two: [Battle of Salsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salsu) in *Goguryeo* against Sui invasion \[612\], and [Battle of Hansando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hansan_Island) in *Joseon* against the Japanese invasion \[1592\]
   * After this, Khitan and *Goryeo* made peace negotiations and a long period of peace followed

&#x200B;

Pre-Mongol-invasion culture of *Goryeo* \- during this time, a few well-known \[in Korea\] historical figures are:

* [Kim Bu-sik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Bu-sik) \- a Confucian scholar who wrote ""[The History of the Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samguk_Sagi)"" - the oldest extant work of Korean history
* [Il-yeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il-yeon) \- a Buddhist monk who wrote ""[The Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samguk_yusa)""
* [Jinul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinul) \- a Buddhist monk, the founder of [Jogye Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogye_Order) (which still exists)
* [Ui-cheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uicheon) \- a Buddhist monk, the founder of [Cheontae Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheontae) (which still exists)

&#x200B;

* **Porcelain**: [Goryeo Ware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goryeo_ware) was well-known for its **distinct color** and qualities
* Ginseng: Korea was famous for its ginseng since the time of *Silla*, exporting it to nearby Tang and Japan. In the *Goryeo* era, Koreans started cultivating ginseng \[but wild ginseng was and is still considered a lot more valuable for cultural reasons\]
* Language: the oldest extant Korean [glossary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin_leishi) was found that provides information about what Medieval Korean was like. Many core vocabularies are similar to modern ones. A relevant Reddit link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/x64jps/an\_ancient\_korean\_glossary\_for\_a\_chinese/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/x64jps/an_ancient_korean_glossary_for_a_chinese/)

&#x200B;

At the end of this period, **a few military generals started taking power as a de facto ruler** of Goryeo, with puppet kings at the royal court.

* Trigger:
   * In 1167, at a royal banquet, the son of the famous Confucian scholar *Kim Bu-sik* (the author of the oldest Korean history chronicle) **burned a** [**respected military general**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Jung-bu) ***Jeong Jung-bu***\*\*'s long beard with a candle\*\*, and made fun of him and also mocked the whole military. The military general developed serious animosity against aristocrats and civilian/Confucian officers after this
   * In 1170, the aristocrats in the royal court forced an old general in his fifties to fight a young soldier. When the old general fell to the ground, a young civilian officer insulted and slapped him. [Jeong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Jung-bu) couldn't stand it anymore and knocked the young civilian officer down. This triggered **the whole military officers to revolt and eventually kill most Confucian advisors** to the king.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi\_Ui-bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Ui-bang): the first military ruler, and a distant ancestor of the founder of *Joseon* dynasty later on. He degenerated into a despot, and killed by *Jeong*
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong\_Jung-bu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Jung-bu) the one whose beard was burnt. After killing *Yi*, he ruled the country himself, but had to deal with rebellions from all over the country (**Buddhist monk rebellions, slave rebellions**)
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeong\_Dae-seung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeong_Dae-seung) the third. He had a private body guard of 100 troops called [Tobang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobang) that attended him all the time
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi\_Ui-min](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Ui-min) the fourth. He was born as a slave, and known to have been very tall and had great strength
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choe\_Chung-heon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choe_Chung-heon) the fifth one who consolidated power and passed it to his descendants (while retaining the puppet kings and royal court). **During his son's reign**, the Mongol Invasion happened

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

4. [**Mongol Invasion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_Korea) \[1231 \~ 1257\]

And Mongols came.

Korean history textbooks tend to just say that when Mongols came, *Goryeo*'s military rulers heavily resisted, but eventually the royal court decided to surrender and become a vassal state.

But when I think about it, it's a bit mysterious. In Korea, I've never heard of Mongol's biological warfare (catapulting plagued corpses into sieged cities) or the reign of terror and depopulating the cities. I learned it by studying the history of Mongol invasions in other regions.

I don't know why Mongol cruelty is not so well-known and discussed in Korea even though Koreans **heavily resisted** the Mongol invasion. For example, during the Mongol invasion, a military dictator of Goryeo **moved the royal court and the entire population of the capital to** [an island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_Korea#Second_Mongol_invasion_of_Korea_(June_1232_%E2%80%93_December_1232)) to resist Mongols. A Korean Buddhist monk **killed the commander of the Horde**.

* I don't know how this didn't end up in catapulting bubonic plagued corpses or the annihilation of the entire royal court and the original capital population. If I find good answers I will add it here. There's also a Reddit discussion about this [https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/ooo4qm/why\_did\_the\_mongols\_have\_such\_difficulties\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/ooo4qm/why_did_the_mongols_have_such_difficulties_in/)

What seems crazy to me is that during the Mongol Invasion, the royal court and military rulers funded to build an **extremely large wooden Buddhist scripture** (that consists of 81,258 wooden printing blocks) called [Tripitaka Koreana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripitaka_Koreana) to call for **divine power and inspire patriotism** among peasants. This gigantic artefact is still well-preserved in [Haeinsa temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haeinsa) in Southern Korea.

* This type of Buddhism is sometimes called ""Patriot Buddhism"" in Korea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The capital **remained in the island for 27 years** resisting Mongols. The Mongols (with Korean collaborators) made multiple invasions and ravaged Korea.

* The peasantry resisted for a long time, but they eventually surrendered with famine and despair. There was a colony of Goryeo defectors in Manchuria (Liaoning peninsula)
* The military ruler Choe clan that **insisted in resisting in the island** was eventually overthrown by the royal court and those who were tired of prolonged war
   * A treaty was signed with Mongols that Goryeo remains as an **autonomous vassal state**, the kings of Goryeo **must marry Mongol princesses**.
* [Sambyeolcho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambyeolcho) \- The military ruler clan's core military unit. Even after the king’s surrender, they revolted and **still fought Mongols, moving from island to island** in the Southwest Korea. They ended up in Jeju ([Tamna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamna)) island, which had a distinct language and statehood back then.
   * The Mongol finally crushed the rebellion in 1273 in Jeju, and took the island under the direct control. They used **Jeju island as a grassland and horse ranch**. The Mongol forces remained in Jeju for more than 100 years (there are a few loan words from Mongolian in [Jeju language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_language)). As a result, Jeju is still famous for its ranches and [horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_horse)s

&#x200B;

\* The Mongols tried to invade Japan via Korea, but **typhoons called** [**Kamikaze**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze_(typhoon)) (""God's Wind"") thwarted the Mongol fleets. While **Korea was completely ravaged, but Japan was intact**.

* I wonder this was what caused a version of [Great Divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divergence) that happened between the Korean Peninsula and Japanese archipelago. Korea declined economically and commercially, but Japan rose

&#x200B;

Mongol's dominance was just about 100 years, but it left a mark that still exists in the Korean culture. For example

* Wedding (bridal) style: Korean traditional [bride](https://imgur.com/a/39HqYxl) and Mongol traditional [bride](https://imgur.com/a/9FAycUD) (from Wikipedia)
   * It is said that the **red dot**s on the bride's face (*Yeonji gonji*) and **coronet** [Jokduri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jokduri) originated from Mongol customs
* [Distilled liquor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_alcoholic_drinks#Distilled_liquors) was introduced by the Mongols. This is the origin of Soju
* Jeju island still being famous for its horses and ranches - they have several Mongol loanwords 
* Mongolian language schools and textbooks survived well into the early years of *Joseon* dynasty

&#x200B;

Also, two people are famous for leaking technologies from Yuan China: 

* [Moon Ik-jeom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mun_Ikjeom) **secretly brought cottonseeds in his writing brush cap** from Yuan China, and started cultivating in Southern Korea
   * I don't know why but this story is very famous among Koreans 
* [Choi Mu-seon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choe_Museon) **brought gunpowder** from Yuan China, which was guarded as a secret. He engineered **cannons and firearms** that helped the founder of *Joseon* dynasty later on 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

5. ***Goryeo*** **songs**

Many of their songs and poems from this era were destroyed and abandoned as ""Songs of sexual affairs/lust (男女相悅之詞)"" or ""Lewd (淫亂)"" by neo-Confucian *Joseon* authorities later on. Some surviving songs are:

**Gasiri**

>Are you going away, going away?  
>  
>Leaving me alone, are you going away?  
>  
>How can I live with you gone away,  
>  
>Should I keep you but if displeased,  
>  
>I fear you would not come back  
>  
>Sadly I would let you go, so please  
>  
>Come back as soon as you leave

\*\* I'm impressed how this theme of ""**a loved one leaving** *(for an unknown place, another country, or the other world; death)*"" is repeated over and over from the ancient time of *Gojoseon* and *Baekje*

&#x200B;

**Cheongsan Byeolgok (The Song of Green Mountains)**

>To live, I wish to live  
>  
>In the green mountains I wish to live  
>  
>Eating wild grapes and hardy kiwis  
>  
>In the green mountains I wish to live  
>  
>*Yali Yali Yallasyeong Yallari Yalla*  
>  
>Cry, cry, birds  
>  
>Wake up, and cry, birds  
>  
>With more worries than you  
>  
>Upon waking I cry too  
>  
>*Yali Yali Yallasyeong Yallari Yalla*

&#x200B;

**Ssanghwajeom (Dumpling store)**

>I went to a dumpling store to buy dumplings (雙花),  
>  
>But a Hui daddy (\* a Muslim merchant) grabbed my wrist.  
>  
>If the words got out of this place,  
>  
>I will tell everyone that it was you, young, little clown.  
>  
>*Deoreodungsheong Darireodireo Darireodireo Daroreogeodireo Daroreo*  
>  
>I will go to that bed to sleep  
>  
>*Wi Wi Daroreogeodireo Daroreo*  
>  
>There's nowhere as messy/promiscuous like that

\*\* This is a surviving ""song of sexual affairs"" - it's a fun song. There's three other stanzas where a Buddhist monk, a pond dragon, and a pub owner ""grabs her wrist""

\*\* **Arab/Muslim merchants** were engaging in trade in Korea and Japan back then. *Goryeo* imported exotic luxuries such as Southeast Asian corals

&#x200B;

**Homosexuality in** ***Hanlim Byeolgok***

* There's a bunch of Chinese style poems called *Gyeonggi Chega*. Most of them are not considered as historically valuable because they're rather imitations of Chinese poems, but some of them got attention because their homosexual tones.
* For example, in a poem, a beautiful boy and a court official ride a swing together, they sing a romantic song together saying that they want to go on a picnic together without being disturbed by others. The male narrator also praises the boy's ""beautiful and delicate hand""
   * ([https://m-blog-naver-com.translate.goog/PostView.naver?isHttpsRedirect=true&blogId=3sang4&logNo=220534386477&\_x\_tr\_sl=ko&\_x\_tr\_tl=en&\_x\_tr\_hl=en&\_x\_tr\_pto=sc](https://m-blog-naver-com.translate.goog/PostView.naver?isHttpsRedirect=true&blogId=3sang4&logNo=220534386477&_x_tr_sl=ko&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc))

***Jeong-gwa-jeong (Jeong***\*\*'s cucumber pavillion)\*\*

Background story:

* A courtier was exiled to present-day Busan (a Southern port city) on charges of treason in 1151. He built a pavilion, grew cucumbers, and played *geomungo* (Korean zither) to comfort his sadness. He wrote this song to plead his innocence and show his loyalty to the king. The pavilion still exists in Busan

>Warbling and missing my lord,  
>  
>A mountain cuckoo I am.  
>  
>The settling moon and morning stars  
>  
>should know it's all frauds and lies  
>  
>Our souls should whenever be together  
>  
>Ah, who was it that so asserted?  
>  
>No errors no misdeeds whatsoever  
>  
>but all groundless stories. Ah, so sad  
>  
>How could you ever forget me?  
>  
>Lord, change your mind and think of me.

6. **The Fall of** ***Goryeo*** \[1351-1392\] 

**Queer king and his Buddhist monk advisor**

* [King Gongmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongmin_of_Goryeo) married a Mongolian princess named [The Grand Queen Noguk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Noguk), and deeply loved her. However, after she died from the childbirth complication, he started developing depression and ""mental instability."" 
   * He started **being pederastic with young men**, and ""went so far as to create a ministry whose sole purpose was to seek out and recruit young men from all over the country to serve in his court."" 
   * It is often said in Korea that the king also cross-dressed in a female clothes in court, but I can't find any credible source for that for now. Perhaps a myth. 
   * He was **most likely bisexual**. Later he got close to a female slave of his Buddhist monk advisor and had a son with her, who later became the next king. 
   * Interestingly, he's known as one of the best artists from the *Goryeo* era - some of his artworks survived to the present day. 
* Mongol's dominance was weakening. Upon the advise from [Choi Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choe_Yeong), a famous military general, King Gongmin **tried to cut the tie with the Mongols**, while establishing new ties with the rising Ming dynasty (Han Chinese dynasty). *Choi Young* **restored some of the northern territories** lost to Mongols. 
   * He tried to reform the land and country with the help of the [Buddhist monk advisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_Don) (who had a dubious background - being born between a princess and a slave) he trusted. However, this was met with fierce resistance from the aristocrats who had benefited from collaborating with the Mongols 
      * The Buddhist monk was killed from the political opposition 
      * Interestingly, King Gongmin was killed by a young man who had an affair with one of his concubines 
* Overall, King Gongmin was not as bad a ruler, but it seems that his ambiguous sexuality contributed to the delegitimizing of him in later records 

&#x200B;

***Choi Young*** and ***Yi Seong-gye*** 

* Two military generals played a central role in the later story. [**Choi Young**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choe_Yeong)**,** a national hero who won many battles with his 2,000 Korean archers in the Red Turban Rebellion in Yuan China, was a loyal patriot. He restored some northern territories in the Korean peninsula in the reign of *Gongmin*. 
   * He came from a famous Confucian scholar family, and was known for his strict asceticism. His motto is still well known among Koreans - ""**Regard gold as nothing but mere stones**."" 
   * One of the *darugachi*s (Yuan governors) of northern territories who surrendered to him was ethnic Korean [Yi Ja-chun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Ja-chun), and his son **Yi Seong-gye**. 
* [Yi Seong-gye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taejo_of_Joseon) grew up to be an excellent military general, and repelled various foreign invasions - the remnants of Mongols, Red Turban rebels from China, and [Japanese pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wokou) 

&#x200B;

**Young king orders his generals to attack Ming China** 

* King Gongmin's son was enthroned at a young age. Ill-advised and inexperienced, he ordered his young general *Yi Seong-gye* to attack Ming China. 
* *Yi Seong-gye* opposed the expedition from the beginning, though. He cited four reasons 

1. A smaller nation should not attack a larger nation, as it goes against the Confucian order of the world 
2. It is harsh to campaign during the summer farming season, as it will result in a poor harvest for the populace
3. With the bulk of the men away to the north, Japanese pirates will have free rein in the south
4. Monsoon rains will reduce the effectiveness of composite bows, the army's main weapon, and will encourage the spread of infectious diseases in the camps.

&#x200B;

**Wihwado Retreat, and the killing of Choi Young and the king of Goryeo** \[1388\] 

* Despite Yi's opposition, the king sent his army to China. However, on the way to China **in an island in Yalu River (Korea-China border)**, Yi decided to **return to the capital of Goryeo and make a coup d'état**. This event is well-known among Koreans as [Wihwado Retreat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wihwado_Retreat). 
* *Choi Young*, the loyal general and former supervisor of Yi, defended the capital and royal court from Yi's army. However, he was eventually defeated, exiled, and later killed. He famously said that ""grass would never grow on my grave"" 
   * He became a popular marshall god in Korean shamanism later on 

&#x200B;

**The Killing of Jung Mong-ju** \[1392\] 

* After the coup, Yi did not ascend to throne right away. He placed two puppet kings between the period of 1388-1392. Yi was well supported by most aristocrats and the general populace, but there were a few prominent **loyalists** for ideological (Confucian) reasons. 
* Yi tried to **win over Goryeo loyalists**, and did many of his operations with his [ambitious third son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taejong_of_Joseon). *Yi Bang-won*, the third son, sent a [famous poem](https://www.donga.com/en/article/all/20070630/253839/1) to [Jeong Mong-ju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Mong-ju), the most famous loyalist: 

&#x200B;

>What's a big deal: this or that?  
>  
>What's a big deal even if the mountain’s kudzu vines become tangled?  
>  
>We’ll be tangled like this and long live and prosper 

&#x200B;

Then the loyalist replied in a poem: 

>Though I die and die again a hundred times,  
>  
>That my bones turn to dust, whether my soul remains or not,  
>  
>Ever loyal to my Lord, how can this red heart ever fade away?

&#x200B;

After this*, Yi Bang-won* (the third son) invited *Jeong* (the loyalist) to a banquet. On the way home from the banquet **at night,** ***Jeong*** **was murdered by five men on the** ***Seonjuk Bridge*** (""Good Bamboo Bridge"") 

* It is said that you can still see his blood on the bridge. The bridge is in the capital of Goryeo, in present-day North Korea 

&#x200B;

*Yi Seong-gye* soon deposed the king, and **crowned himself as the founder of a new dynasty,** ***Joseon***. \[1392\]

The history of Joseon is extremely well documented - both in classical Chinese (official court records) and vernacular Korean with the invent of the Korean writing system in 1443. 

* Much of Goryeo royalty was executed. It is said in Korea that **anyone with the last name** ***Wang*** **was killed**, or changed their last name to survive. 
* The [extant official historical record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goryeosa) about *Goryeo* was written in Joseon dynasty - it is said that the history written by the Goryeo dynasty themselves was burned and abandoned later. Thus, current scholarship tends to be careful about potential biases in the record. 
* The *Goryeo-Joseon* transition is one of the most dramatized events in pre-modern Korean history, so the description was a bit lengthy.",1663115629.0,2022-09-14 00:33:49+00:00
381,Bookclub Wednesday!,48,xdyx0a,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xdyx0a/bookclub_wednesday/,46," Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, [r/history](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/) also has a recommended list of things to \[read, listen to or watch\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist))",1663153211.0,2022-09-14 11:00:11+00:00

383,"European royalty vs. local culture, I don't understand something...",57,xdlhpl,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xdlhpl/european_royalty_vs_local_culture_i_dont/,48,"For years and years I've read about the countless intermarriages, dynasties, royal houses, etc. that ruled Europe. Based on their actions, the entire continent essentially seemed like one big property split amongst very few families, with relatives going off to rule distant and quite disparate lands- one uncle off to Spain, a daughter to Holland, a cousin to Austria, a brother to England, and so on and so forth.

My confusion is this: the cultures of these countries vary widely from one another. Music, food, language, traditions, climate, etc. etc. etc. are all quite different. It's hard for me to imagine so few bloodlines/families just comfortably picking up and moving to run a country that's so different or, if they did integrate, far flung relatives coming together from these lands and being culturally compatible. In essence, all the thrones seemed to be involved in a huge game of musical chairs with very few families playing, but said thrones were in such different cultural locations. How did it work? There are three explanations I can come up with...

1. The ruling elite did not, in fact, integrate well with the local cultures. An Austrian princess sent to Spain remained, in essence, an Austrian. The vast differences in the root cultures did not really permeate the personal culture of the monarchs.
2. The royals were much broader in education, exposure, and behavior than people today, such that said Austrian princess could float comfortably between Andalusia and the courts of Vienna, or any other number of places, without appearing or feeling out of place. Linguistically I could see this, but culturally I'm having a hard time buying it.
3. Somewhat a combination of 1. and 2., there was a different high general culture, a court one I suppose, that was universal across these lands and that's all that really mattered. These families all followed more or less a pan-continental culture of the nobility, and with minor help from translators and whatnot, could rule the different regional people.

Basically if you've spent any time with people from, say, England, Spain, and France, you'd see my confusion. Thoughts? Thanks!",1663110152.0,2022-09-13 23:02:32+00:00

CE]: the less-famous warfares at Thermopylae, the Philippopolis' siege, etc. As these were deciphered from the palimpsest leaves of Cod.Vind.hist.gr. 73 [Scythica Vindobonensia-Dexippus]... at least till my readings",25,xcin34,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xcin34/scenes_from_the_romangothic_wars_3rd_c_ce_the/,3,"Maybe a known work & findings, however I've tracked them lately, and were a quite interesting read...

In an 11th c. byzantine manuscript \[Cod. Vind. hist. gr. 73\], they were discovered four palimpsest leaves \[8 pages\], which they were hiding some greek writing. Till my readings, the 6 out of 8 pages have been deciphered in some sufficient way, and they have been divided in 3 parts \[Empire in Crisis \[2020\], pp. 8-9\]. All scholars agree that the texts should be from Dexippus' Scythica of the 3rd c. CE, describing the Gothic invasions in Greek mainland of the same century.

\-\[the deciphered greek text can be seen in Anhang I, Empire in Crisis \[2020\], pp. 545ff\].

I'm giving here a somehow summary of each part with some notes and references, based on the deciphered text & on the available analyses-translations by the scholars.

&#x200B;

**a. Fragment Ia–Ib, fol. 195rv \[two pages\]**

The excerpt actually describes some preliminary war tactics by Cniva \[the Gothic general & king of the 3rd c. CE\] trying to take some Thracian city; which it has been identified by the scholars as Philippopolis, besieged and taken in 250 CE.

\_\*an english translation of the 1st page 195r in Martin & Grusková \[2014b\], p. 737 // and a german translation of 2nd page 195v in Grusková & Martin \[2015\], p. 39

>The Scythians \[=Goths\] withdrew pretending that they abandoned the siege, so to confuse the Thracians, and camped some distance away. And it seems that the besieged believed it and relaxed somehow. However, a traitor approached Cniva and promised to show to him the spot of the city's fortifications, which would be passed more easily. Cniva picked 5 volunteers and sent them at night so to confirm the information; he actually had also set prizes. The Thracian guards were drunk or asleep and the 5 Scythians managed to remove them and pass. Then they gave a signal with a torch and 500 men of Cniva tried to enter the city with ladders, but the Thracians noticed them...

""*the identification of the town as Philippopolis is possible and plausible, though by no means certain.*"" Grusková & Martin \[2014b\], p. 748

&#x200B;

**b. Fragment IIa–IIb, fol. 194rv \[two pages\]**

If I understood well, the first page of this text \[194r\] had some more difficulties regarding deciphering. In any case it seems describing some war preparations by Roman emperor Decius against Goths, but after the fall of Philippopolis in 250 CE.

\_\*a german translation of 1st page 194r in Grusková & Martin \[2014c\], p. 33 // and an english translation of 2nd page 194v in Grusková & Martin \[2014b\], p. 736

>Ptolemeus the Athenian was set by the emperor to guard the area between Macedonia and Thessaly. And Athenians, Boeotians and some selected Lacedaimonians  gathered  at the narrow and safer passage of Thermopylae, probably waiting for the enemy. Here the text doesn't seem crystal clear. Nevertheless, most possibly the leader of the Scythians \[=Goths\], named Ostroggouthos, was informed that the Scythians took Philippopolis and that Cniva was praised for it. So under some pressure to accomplish a similar achievement, he started marching against Decius with 50000 men.  
>  
>Decius gathered 80000 soldiers and waited at Amissos near Beroina \[?\]. When he was informed that Ostroggouthos' army was near, he decided to speak to his men. He tried to reanimate their spirit, saying that they shouldn't be discouraged by some recent misadventure in the nearby field and the defeat at Thrace \[Philippopolis\], but they should accept reality like prudent men. Because the first failure \[in the nearby field at Beroina\] came cause of the scouts, while the Thracian city was lost by ambushes...

As Philippopolis is taken and Decius is still alive, the narrated events should be placed somewhere between, 250-251 CE.

The historic elements of this excerpt have been mostly compared with the Jordanes' Getica of the 6th c. CE, then with Syncellus' Ekloge chronographias of the 8th-9th c. CE. The latter is using as source Dexippus, as it's stated in the work.

In Jordanes \[Get. 101\], when the king Ostrogotha died it seems that Cniva took afterwards the leadership of the Goths. If both accounts are accurate, this would mean that Cniva maybe served for sometime as general under Ostrogotha's command; though there could be some anachronisms. \[Regarding leader Ostroggouthos: ""*It occurs otherwise only in Latin sources: see in particular Jord. Get. 98–100, where the form Ostrogotha is used.*"", Grusková & Martin \[2014b\], p. 740\].

Regarding the toponyms Amissos & Beroina, where Decius waited and gave his speech \[Grusková & Martin \[2014b\], p. 740\]:

""*The text may contain (an) unknown geographical name(s) or corrupted known name(s).*"" But adding: ""*an association may immediately suggest itself with Beroea in Thracia (Βέροια or Βερόη, Beroea, Beroa, or Berone of the Tabula Peutingeriana VIII 2), the town where Cniva ambushed Decius several months before the moment when our passage is set*"".

It's probably related with the misadventure in the nearby field at Beroina, that Decius mentions in his speech; i.e. a previous failure at Beroa. Jordanes \[Get. 102\] had written that Decius faced unsuccessfully Cniva there, but in a course of events that would place it after Ostrogotha's death; possible anachronism.

\* Thermopylae are given as 'gates' \[πύλαι\] in the greek text.

&#x200B;

**c. Fragment IIIb–IIIc, fol. 192v+193r \[two pages\]**

Maybe the most confusing excerpt regarding dating and identification of the mentioned persons.

\_\*an english translation of both pages 192v+193r in Mallan & Davenport \[2015\], p. 205ff

>After an unsuccessful try to besiege the city of Thessalonica, the Scythians \[=Goths\] decided to march against Athens and Achaea aiming for the loot. When the news were heard, the Greeks started to be gathered at the narrow coastal passage of Thermopylae, carrying spears, axes, or whatever each could & then fortifying an already existing wall. Afterwards the generals were elected: Marianus, who had been previously chosen by the Roman emperor to govern Greece south of Thermopylae, Philostratus the Athenian, and Dexippus the Boeotian \[possibly not our historian\]. And in order to to encourage the men, Marianus gave a speech. According to its start \[which is the only that has been read\], he tried to remind to the Greeks the importance of the place of Thermopylae during previous battles, like in the Persian wars \[480 BCE\], the Lamian war \[323 BCE\] & against Antiochus under Roman leadership \[191 BCE\]...

The text unfortunately stops before some battle. Syncellus \[Ecl.Chron. 466\] is also speaking of a military force gathering at Thermopylae, after a successful defense at Thessalonica, in the years of Gallienus. Neither there a battle followed. And it's noticeable that comparing this text with the previous one of the Decius' years, Thermopylae should be considered a good spot for defense. However, here an encouraging speech to the soldiers was given and generals were elected. While it has been noted eg. a successful defense in Achaea during the years of Gallienus \[HA Gall. 6.1\].

\*Thermopylae are given here, too, as 'gates' \[πύλαι\] in the greek deciphered text. While with its complete name in Syncellus.

Generally he text has been compared mainly with Syncellus' Ekloge chronographias of the 8th-9th c. CE. & Historia Augusta, Gallieni duo. But other sources too, like Zosimus & Zonaras.

One other point that I've noticed is how general Marianus was identifying the Greco-Romans, to whom he spoke; i.e. with the Greeks defending against Persians in the 5th c. BCE, with the anti-Macedonian league who defeated Antipater in 323 BCE & with some united-said Greco-Roman forces who fought against Antiochus in 191 BCE. Noticeable that it isn't mentioned the case of 279 BCE, when mainly the Aetolians faced the Celts. However, here only the start of the speech is surviving.

On the possible dating I've read various aspects placing the events mainly during the reign of Gallienus \[253-268 CE\], in a length of about 16 years; i.e. 253/4, 259, 262, 267/8 \[the latter however being more doubtful\]; and this I presume has roots in the identification of the persons \[like general Marianus\] and the parallel reading of the rest sources \[check Martin & Grusková \[2014a\], Mallan & Davenport \[2015\], p. 215, Potter \[2016\], p. 336, Boteva \[2020\], p. 207\].

* ""... *the defeat of the Goths in (most likely) 262/263, by the population of Achaea under the leadership of Marianus, Philostratus, and the Boeotian Dexippus*"". Mallan \[2020\], p. 252 // for 262 CE check also Mallan & Davenport \[2015\]
* ""*So far, the modern authors working on the new fragments are discussing two possible years in the attempt to date this siege of Thessalonica, AD 253/254 and AD 262,58 and each of the two has devoted advocates, who date this siege using literary texts: Historia Augusta, Gallieni duo (late 4th c.), Zosimus (5th c.), Georgius Syncellus (8th c.) and Zonaras (12th c.). It seems now that the available late-antique and Byzantine texts cannot be of further help when trying to reason which one of the two years was really marked by the Scythians’ (to use the language of the palimpsest) unsuccessful siege of Thessalonica and by the urgent organization of the defence of Thermopylae*"". Boteva \[2020\], p. 207
* ""*... I now think that it is wisest to be somewhat agnostic and recognize the possibility that the events at Thermopylae may be earlier than the siege and capture of Philippopolis in 250, but that too is problematic as the Gothic operations still seem quite distant from Thermopylae*"".

387,"200 houses, 1500 inhabitants, 100 years of existence, 133 thousand eaten horses and a shaman's skull with holes - this is a Stone Age settlement called Botai.",1179,xbpjef,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xbpjef/200_houses_1500_inhabitants_100_years_of/,70,"The Stone Age is the longest era in the history of mankind and the foundation of the Bronze Age. It began almost two and a half million years ago and ended about 5 thousand years ago.

At the end of the Stone Age, all ice ages ended long ago and the climate became very similar to the modern one. People of that time reached perfection in the construction of dwellings, the manufacture of tools from stone, bone, and wood.

They have learned to live in one place for a long time and rationally use natural resources for food. Therefore, at the end of the Stone Age, in the Eneolithic era, large settlements with long-term dwellings appeared. These were good buildings where people lived for decades.

Archaeologists have discovered the remains of more than a dozen such settlements in the Southern Urals, Southern Bashkiria and Northern Kazakhstan. Judging by the ceramic utensils, tools, stone processing technique, this territory was occupied by a population with similar households.

Some villages were inhabited only during the summer or winter season, and many of them were inhabited all year round. The settlements became especially crowded in autumn and winter. In autumn, they repaired roofs and built new dwellings, in winter they organized joint hunts for large animals: wild horses, bison, saigas. Prosperous hunting and good housing were a guarantee of survival in the harsh steppe climate.

The largest, long-term and all-season settlement of this era was discovered on the banks of the steppe river Iman-Burluk in northern Kazakhstan. Archaeologists called this settlement Botai. There once stood more than two hundred dwellings, which occupied an area of ​​about 8 hectares. The settlement was founded between the 4th and 3rd millennium BC and existed for at least 100 years.

They began to build their first dwellings along the stream in the valley. On the south side, a small village was protected by a steep bank of a steppe river, and from the north, forested hills.

Years passed and the population of the village grew, and new ones were added to the old dwellings. Original ""quarters"" were formed, in which there were up to three dozen buildings. Between them lay ""streets"" up to 8 m wide and up to 50 m long.

The smallest dwelling had an area of ​​20 square meters, and the largest - 75. In the center on the floor there was usually a recess for the hearth. Often there were traces of another hearth nearby. It probably served for additional heating in the coldest winters. Hearths served not only for heating, but also for cooking and firing pottery.

In the depths of the room, under the wall, there was usually a pit-cellar for storing food.

Most of the finds were found on the floor near the hearth, on the side opposite from the entrance, or in niches in clay walls. That is, the ancient inhabitants spent most of their time at the hearth, and kept their household utensils in the niches of the walls. The space to the left and right of the entrance was occupied by beds for sleeping.

In the explored part of the Botai settlement, a collection of stone axes, flint and jasper tips, scrapers, piercers, drills and many other tools was collected. Dishes were restored from hundreds of fragments of ceramics. Only in the investigated part of the settlement (10% of the total area) were found bones from 133 thousand horses. In addition, the bones of foxes, wolves, dogs, bison, deer, bears, beavers and other animals are well preserved on the floor and around the dwellings.

At that time, the population had already formed beliefs and rituals. This is evidenced by the finds under the ""threshold"" at the entrance of some dwellings of the burial of the skull of a horse or dog. And sometimes both together. It is likely that the horse was a symbol of good prey, and the dog was a ghostly guardian of the dwelling.

In one of the dwellings in a wall niche, archaeologists found a human skull covered with red clay. Perhaps it was the skull of a shaman worshiped by the tribesmen. Three holes were drilled in this skull during the life of a person.

Of course all our regular rules and guidelines still apply and to be just that bit extra clear:

391,When it comes to Cold War history and its relationship with the Anti Apartheid Movement which is more accurate to say? That Nelson Mandela and the ANC was allied with the Soviet Union or that they were part of the Non-aligned coalition?,16,xae07u,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/xae07u/when_it_comes_to_cold_war_history_and_its/,5,"During the history of the Cold War there were 2 camps that emerged. First was the camp of the West and its allies, especially the N.A.T.O alliance. And the Soviet Bloc and its allies in the communist alliance. Then you had a 3rd section called the Non Aligned movement. Leaders such as Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, Egypt's Nasser, Tito from Yugoslavia. Then you have a complicated factor in this history and that is leaders who had one foot in one of the Cold War camps and another foot in the non aligned movement. For example Castro was on paper a Soviet ally. But under his leadership Cuba was also part of the Non aligned movement, with him being the general secretary from 1979-1983. On the other side of this coin Suharto of Indonesia was a Western ally. But at the same time kept Indonesia in the non aligned movement. Nehru of India was non aligned but India leaned more to the Soviet side during his leadership.

Now when you add Nelson Mandela and his organisation the ANC into this complicated mix its interesting. Because he and the ANC initially sought assistance from the United States in the apartheid struggle. But they were turned down in 1960 according to him(that was during the Eisenhower Administration). Later they sought assistance from the Soviet Union and especially Cuba and they received it. In 1961 when Che Guevara published his classic on guerilla warfare Mandela and the ANC leaders incorporated it into the doctrines of the military wing the formed called UmKhonto Wesizwe(Spear of the Nation). In 1962 Che met Spear of a Nation fighters. Before this Oliver Tambo(who would serve as leader of the ANC in exile when Mandela was imprisoned) would visit the Soviet Union to have advisers train ANC fighters and also developed ties with the East German government. Later on when when the South African border war developed in the various theatres such as Angola, Namibia, and Zambia the ANC allied with the independence fighters their as well as the Cuban armed forces and the MPLA marxists in Angola, receiving training in Cuban training camps present as well as participating with Cuban regulars in the theatres of war against the apartheid regimes military.

At the same time the ANC maintain ties with some Western countries where they could get support such as the Swedish government, the Australian government and especially the Canadian government. Canada is interesting too because Mandela and the ANC developed ties under Canada's conservative governments(John Diefenbaker and Brian Mulroney). Furthermore Mandela emphasised repeatedly the ANC's independence in terms of its relations with foreign nations and a bigger bulk of his support came from Third world nations who at the time were explicitly non aligned such as Ben Bella's Algeria or Nasser's Egypt.

The meaning of the joke — if it even is a joke — has been lost.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/x3ot4p/korean\_history\_dates\_back\_to\_a\_bronze\_culture/](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/x3ot4p/korean_history_dates_back_to_a_bronze_culture/)

&#x200B;

After the fall of Gojoseon, **a chain of kingdoms and federations of small chiefdoms sprung up** across Manchuria and the Korean peninsula, ultimately **consolidating into three** ***(Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla)***. This period is called Three Kingdom period in Korean history

**Two types of foundation myths**

* There are largely two types of foundation myths shared across these small kingdoms.
   * One is what I call Northern myths - the descendants of the heaven god **come from the Northern territories** and found a kingdom (shared by Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Baekje).
      * Details are in my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/x3ot4p/korean_history_dates_back_to_a_bronze_culture/) about Gojoseon
   * The second type is what I call Southern myths - the first king or the progenitor of a clan is **born out of an egg**. *(Silla Park clan's* [Hyeokgeose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyeokgeose_of_Silla)*, Silla Seok clan's* [Talhae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talhae_of_Silla)*, and Gaya's* [Kim Suro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suro_of_Geumgwan_Gaya)*)*
      * Interestingly, Gaya's Suro is said to have married an Indian princess named Ayuta. Now a Korean city and an Indian city are sister cities based on this, lol. Mysterious.

&#x200B;

**Ancient social customs**:

* A lot of what we know about these small kingdoms and chiefdoms come from a 3rd century Chinese historical text called ""Record of the Three Kingdoms: Book of Wei - Biographies of Dongyi (""Eastern Barbarians"")
   * I posted the translation of one part of this Chinese record, though not all [https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/txt1qx/ancient\_chinese\_records\_of\_korean\_kingdoms\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/txt1qx/ancient_chinese_records_of_korean_kingdoms_the/)
   * According to the record, most of these kingdoms had their own annual **festivals where they eat, drink, sing, and dance all day long**
   * Buyeo, the northernmost ancient Koreanic kingdom, practiced sunjang - an ancient human sacrifice where they buried servants of the deceased alive. The same practice existed in ancient China too.
      * Buyeo's highest officials were named after six animals - The House of Horse, The House of Ox, The House of Pig, The House of Dog, etc.
   * It seems that in the Northern states, **early arranged marriage** was common - in Okjeo (a small Northeastern kingdom), a **child-bride** would live with the child-groom's family until adulthood, while in Goguryeo (a Northern kingdom), a **child-groom** would live with his future wife's family to help their work
   * In the small chiefdoms in the Southern part of the peninsula, each state had a sacred district called Sodo, where **spirits were worshipped through rituals using a pole attached with a rattle and drum**. The district was sacred and was independent of the boundaries of political administration. It functioned as **asylums for refugees and criminals**, a sacred place unreached by secular authority.
      * A ritual song from one of the Southern chiefdoms survived. It goes:

>Turtle, turtle, stick out your head  
>  
>If you do not, we'll roast and eat you

* lol this song was obviously from an era when life was simpler and more mystical. There's also a hypothesis that the language spoken in this Southern region (Gaya) was closer to Japonic, rather than Koreanic languages.
* Other folk traditions such as **stone fight** ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seokjeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seokjeon)) and Ganggangsullae (**women dancing in a circle under the full moon**) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganggangsullae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganggangsullae)) might have originated from this ancient time

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Wars, battles, and** ***Baekje*****'s peak**

* [Samguk Sagi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samguk_Sagi) (History of Three Kingdoms - ***Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla***), compiled in 1145 by a Korean scholar based on previous records (which are lost now), provides quite detailed stories of wars and battles. According to this, the small Korean kingdoms were **constantly warring with each other**, as well as Chinese, northern nomadic, and Japanese kingdoms.
* [The founder of Baekje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onjo_of_Baekje), the son of a *Goguryoe* king, went to the **southwestern part of the peninsula** and conquered the pre-existing smaller kingdoms. A king **committed suicide**, asking his enemy to take care of his people with **kindness and mercy**.
* Around 350 AD, *Baekje* thrived from **triangle trade** between Liao peninsula of China, Kyushu island of Japan, and the Korean peninsula.
* At the same time, the northern kingdom *Goguryeo* moved its capital southwards to modern-day **Pyongyang** because of the attacks from Northern nomadic tribes. This caused a conflict with *Baekje* in the south, and ultimately the *Goguryeo* king **was killed** at Pyongyang castle.
   * *Baekje* also engaged in constant small battles with *Silla*, stealing and being stolen castles.
* *Baekje* had **a close tie with the emerging ancient kingdom in Japan**. It is said that *Baekje*'s scholar [Wang-in/Wani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wani_(scholar)) introduced the Chinese writing system and Confucian classics to Japan. *Baekje*'s king also gave a [seven-branched ceremonial sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-Branched_Sword) to Japan's ruler
   * Japan claims that this was a tribute from *Baekje* to Japan, while Korea claims that this was a generous gift from *Baekje*'s king. East Asian ancient history is funny - a 1,700 years old artifact is still the subject of intense emotional debates.
* Around 380 AD, **an** [**Indian Buddhist monk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marananta) came to *Baekje* via China. *Baekje*'s king welcomed him in the palace, and soon **adopted Buddhism** and constructed a Buddhist temple.

\*\* Around this time, *Silla* was still not much more than a federation of small city-states, ruled by three clans in turn - *Park, Seok, and Kim* clans. The early records of *Silla* implies a close (both [friendly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talhae_of_Silla) and hostile) relationship with Japan. Its early ruler exchanged envoys with [Queen Himiko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalla_of_Silla), but later Japan frequently [invaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heulhae_of_Silla) Silla

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The rise of** ***Goguryeo*****, and decline of** ***Baekje***

* Around 370 AD, *Goguryeo* was seriously weakened. In order to suppress tribalism that weakened the kingdom, a [new king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosurim_of_Goguryeo) integrated Confucian ideologies into political institutions - by (1)  establishing **schools** for the children of nobility (2) i**ntroducing** [**Confucian laws**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritsury%C5%8D) **and codifying regional customs** (3) adopting Buddhism for religious life.
* The next king successfully attacked *Baekje* and formed an alliance with *Baekje*'s neighbor, *Silla*, which was still a small emerging state.
* The next king, [**Gwanggaeto the Great**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwanggaeto_the_Great)**,** significantly **expanded the territory into Manchuria** and **into the southern part of the Korean peninsula**, conquering present-day Seoul.
   * He defeated proto-Mongolic kingdoms and **regained the ancient territory of Gojoseon**. He also annexed the remainder of *Buyeo*, the northernmost Koreanic kingdom. He built a large empire, and left [**the largest engraved stele**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwanggaeto_Stele) in the world.
   * He also protected *Silla* from the attack of *Baekje-*Japan alliance. He made hostage a *Silla* prince, and made him the king of *Silla* later on.
* *Gwanggaeto the Great* died at the age of 39, but his son *Jangsu* **reigned for 79 years until the age of 98** \- **the longest reign** in East Asian history. He changed the name of the country to **Goryeo, from which Korea originated**.
   * He successfully managed complicated diplomatic relationships with Chinese, Mongolic, and Tungusic dynasties that were warring with each other (\* There was no unified Chinese state at this time.) Now he tried to conquer *Baekje, Silla, and Gaya* (a small federation of city-states between Baekje and Silla) in the southern part of the peninsula
* By this time, *Baekje* was significantly weakened. It already lost a big part of its former territory to *Gugoryeo*. It was put in a weaker position vis-a-vis its old ally Japan. Political chaos ensued, and [brothers killed each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeonji_of_Baekje) for the throne
* The *Goguryeo* king sent a **Buddhist monk as a spy** to *Baekje*'s palace in modern-day Seoul. The Buddhist monk **played** ***go*** with t*he Baekje king* every day, and talked him into spending money in expensive construction projects.
   * With the information from the monk, the *Goguryeo* king invaded *Baekje*, **conquered the capital (modern-day Seoul), burned it to the ground,** and **slew the** ***Baekje*** **king**. The whole *Baekje* nobles ran southwards, retaining a small territory in Southwestern Korea

\*\* *Silla* was still a small peripheral country in the southeastern part of the Korean peninsula, protected by the [mountain ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobaek_Mountains) that surround it. Initially starting as the federation of three clans, their royal blood got concentrated by [**marriage between cousins**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naemul_of_Silla)**.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Baekje-Silla*** **alliance, betrayal, and** **the rise of** ***Silla***

* After the death of the successful *Goguryeo* king (*Jangsu*) at the age 98, *Goguryeo* gradually sled into succession problems and political instability
* In the meantime, *Baekje and Silla* formed an [alliance by marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongseong_of_Baekje) against the powerful *Goguryeo*.
   * *Baekje* still maintained their tie with Japan - one of the female descendants of a [Baekje king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muryeong_of_Baekje) **gave birth to a Japanese emperor**
* In the meantime, two kings in *Silla* quietly led a reform that would stabilize *Silla* as a kingdom beyond the federation of tribes. They (1) took the Chinese royal title 'wang' (=king), (2) adopted Buddhism
   * In a famous legend, a Buddhist monk named I cha-don sacrificed his life, **with white blood spurting from his throat**. After this miracle, *Silla* aristocrats got terrified and accepted Buddhism
* With the help of their ally *Silla*, [a new Baekje king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seong_of_Baekje) was able to restore the central part of Korea. However, a Silla king [Jin-heung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinheung_of_Silla), under a secret agreement with *Goguryeo*, attacked unexpecting *Baekje* army and took the central part of Korea. **Furious with the betrayal**, the *Baekje king* attacked *Silla*, but it turned out to be a disastrous battle - the ***baekje*** **king and 30,000 of soldiers got killed**.
   * After this, *Baekje* got almost irreversibly weak. The **slain king's two brothers, one son, and two grandsons all left to Japan** at some point, starting their own clan there.
      * [One of these men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Asa) became the teacher of [Prince Shotoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Sh%C5%8Dtoku), a famous, semi-legendary Japanese **regent** who systemized Japanese administration and promoted Buddhism. It is said that he made a portrait of Prince Shotoku at Horyu-ji temple, an important temple in the old Japanese capital. [A brother of his](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Imseong) became the ancestor of [Ouchi clan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cuchi_clan) in Western Japan 
   * The *Silla* king erected an engraved stele for himself, and organized a youth warrior group called **""**[**Flowering nights**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwarang)**""**
      * Which is often associated with Greek-style homosexuality later on
* For a while, both *Baekje and Silla* had a weird phase. A Buddhist *Baekje* king announced complete ban on all killings, hunting, and butchering. A *Silla* king was dethroned by his mother because he refused to marry his aunt (his mother's sister).
* [A Baekje king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_of_Baekje) is known to have married a *Silla* princess, despite the intense rivalry between the two kingdoms. The legend says that when the young prince fell in love with the princess, he disguised as a commoner in *Silla*, and **taught** ***Silla*****'s children a song**, handing them out **(edible) sweet kudzu**. The song survived as a poem:

>Princess Seonhwa, after a secret affair,  
>  
>Steals away at night, with Seodong in her arms

* The legend says that the children **spread this song in** ***Silla*****'s capital**, and the angry father of the princess kicked her out. Then the *Baekje* prince married her.

\*\* During the similar time period, *Goguryeo*'s Princess [Pyongyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Pyeonggang) also married an unconventional suitor - an ""ugly, dumb"" commoner called On-dal who became a general later. They're also common household folktale names in Korea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The unified China's attack, and the destruction of the Sui army at the Battle of Salsu**

* In the meantime, an important geopolitical change happened - China, which was divided in pieces for a few hundred years, became unified under the Sui dynasty.

(copied from [https://www.reddit.com/r/DidYouKnowHistory/comments/demjr3/when\_koreans\_used\_a\_dammed\_river\_to\_destroy\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DidYouKnowHistory/comments/demjr3/when_koreans_used_a_dammed_river_to_destroy_an/))

* In 612, Emperor Yang of Sui **invaded** ***Goguryeo*** with well over one million men. In fact, *Goguryeo* successfully defended this. Famously, the *Goguryeo* general [Eulji Mundeok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salsu) defended against the Sui forces for months, **while secretly building a dam** at the Salsu River, cutting off the flow of water in the river. When the unsuspecting Sui troops were halfway across the river, Eulji opened the dam, **causing the onslaught of water to drown about 300,000 of Sui soldiers**. The *Goguryeo* cavalry then charged into the remaining Sui forces, inflicting enormous casualties. This is **one of the most legendary victories** in Korean history
   * The failure of the Korean campaign brought down the short-lived Sui dynasty, to be replaced by Tang
* However, this **also weakened** ***Goguryeo***
   * After this, *Goguryeo* was building its own version of the **Great Wall**, but the royalty tried to kill a [young, popular general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeon_Gaesomun) who was in charge of this. When the young general discovered the plot, he **threw a lavish banquet** and invited one hundred royalties and aristocrats. **At the banquet he slew all of them**, went to the place and **murdered the king**. After that, he enthroend a young nephew of the king. Political instability ensued

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Silla*****'s Queens, Flowering Knights, and the alliance with the rising Tang China**

* In the meantime, *Silla* had two **queen regnant**s due to their [micro-caste (bone rank)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone-rank_system) system. There was no male heir in their royal caste (**""sacred bone"" caste**) anymore
* There was K[im Yu-sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gim_Yu-sin), a renowned *Hwarang* **(Flowering Knight) warrior,** a commander of *Silla* army at the age of 34, and a cousin of the new queen. His bloodline was noble enough, and he could have revolted and claimed the crown. Instead he **stayed loyal to the queen, and was protective of her**.
* [Queen Seondeok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Seondeok_of_Silla) was the **second female sovereign in recorded East Asian history**. She's considered as a decent monarch, won the heart of people, and built many important **cultural monuments** that are **still tourist attractions** in the ancient city of Gyeongju after 1,400 years. However, most importantly, she was the first *Silla* monarch who decided to **form an alliance with the rising Tang dynasty**, while dealing with the constant attacks from *Baekje and Goguryeo*
   * Some say that *Baekje and Goguryeo* attacked *Silla* more because they were **more emboldened by the female ruler** of the enemy
   * **The Emperor of Tang did not take her seriously either** (because she's a woman), but with the threat from *Goguryeo*, he ultimately agreed that it was a good idea to form an alliance with *Silla*
   * One of her highest officials also [plotted a rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Seondeok_of_Silla#Bidam's_rebellion) against her because ""**a woman should stop ruling.**"" However, Kim Yu-shin, the loyal Flowering Knight warrior and commander, calmed down the anxious queen and excellently took care of the rebellion. There's an interesting legend about the use of **astrology** here (if anyone's interested, click the link above)
* After the two queens passed away, the first queen's nephew, [Kim Chun-chu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muyeol_of_Silla) \- who used to be the highest caste ""sacred bone"" but was degraded to ""true bone"" for a political reason - was **enthroned** with the support of his brother-in-law and friend K*im Yu-shin* (the Flowering Knight guy).
   * There's an interesting [legend](https://world.kbs.co.kr/service/contents_view.htm?lang=e&menu_cate=culture&id=&board_seq=129745&page=4&board_code=akoreas_ani) about how the king married K*im Yu-shin*'s **sister**. Kim Yu-shin had two sisters, *Munhee and Bohee*. One night, Bohee, the older sister, had a dream where she urinated on the mountaintop until the urine flooded the entire capital city. Upon hearing the odd dream, Munhee instinctively knew that it was an auspicious dream, and suggested she buy the dream in exchange for a silk skirt. Bohee sold her dream immediately. Later, Munhee met and fell in love with *Kim Chun-chu*, and became the queen of unified *Silla* later on.
      * There's more interesting details in the link. Kim Yu-shin was originally very upset about his sister's affair with *Kim Chun-chu* (because he already had a wife), and tried to burn her alive. **The queen was shocked to find it out, and saved his sister's life**.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Fall of** ***Baekje***

* Before he became the new king of *Silla*, K*im Chun-chu* had lost his daughter and son-in-law in a *Baekje* attack. Some say that he particularly wanted a **revenge** on this. He was already a good friend of the Emperor of Tang, and he constantly pleaded the emperor to send army to destroy *Baekje*. In 660 AD, the Emperor finanlly acquiesced and sent 130,000 soldiers through the sea.
* *Kim Yu-shin*, the Flowering Knight commander, set out with his own 50,000 soldiers to *Baekje*, to rendezvous with the Tang army. *Baekje* court was **already corrupt and decadent**. Upon the news, only 5,000 soldiers and 1 general stayed to fight with the *Silla* army.
   * In a famous story, [Gyebaek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyebaek), the last *Baekje* general, **killed his wife and children with his sword a night before his last battle** to prevent them from being enslaved
   * In the battle of *Hwangsanbeol*, the 5,000 *Baekje* soldiers fought so fiercely they overwhelmed the 50,000 *Silla* army for a while. [In a legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hwangsanbeol), a *Silla* general sent his **young Flowering Knight** son to fight the *Baekje* army single-handedly. The young warrior got captured and killed. With this sacrifice, the *Silla* army regained morale and destroyed the last army of *Baekje*.
* There's a very famous legend in Korea that the last king of *Baekje*, Ui-ja, **jumped off a cliff with his three thousand court maidens**. Even though the story is not historically accurate, there's still a cliff called ""Falling Flowers Rock"" ([nak-hwa-am](https://folkency.nfm.go.kr/en/topic/detail/5467)) in the southewest part of Korea.

&#x200B;

* Lots of *Baekje* royal family and nobles fled to Japan - some already left for Japan even before the fall of *Baekje*. Some say that this mass migration impacted the language and culture of **the emerging Japanese ruling class/ aristocracy**.

&#x200B;

* There's one surviving song/poem from *Baekje*, recorded in a 14th century Korean [book ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhak_gwebeom)\- it's a song of a **peddler's wife**, having a nocturnal thought about his safety

>\[The Song of *Jeong-eup*\]  
>  
>Moon, rise high up and beam far away.  
>  
>(chant) eogui ya eogangdyoli, a-heu, a-eu darong diri  
>  
>Are you now in the market street, I fear you may step on mud  
>  
>(chant) eogui ya eogangdyoli  
>  
>Lay your luggage down, I fear darkness may fall on you  
>  
>(chant) eogui ya eogangdyoli, a-eu darong diri

\*\* *Jeong-eup* is a provincial town that still exists in the southwest part of Korea

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Fall of Goguryeo, and the Unified Silla's War with Tang China**

* While there are many tragic folktales about *Baekje*'s fall, there are not so many about the fall of *Goguryeo*. The once-powerful *Goguryeo* got into a downward spiral when *Yeon Gaesomun*, the despotic general who enthroned a puppet king, died. His sons and brothers got caught up in nasty power struggles, and the Emperor of Tang did not miss the opportunity. In 668 AD, the Tang army put Pyongyang under siege in concert with the Silla army. Most factions in *Goguryeo* surrendered - that was the end of the once powerful state.
   * A son of a *Goguryeo* noble became an important general in Tang dynasty ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao\_Xianzhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Xianzhi)), taking part in Tang's multiple expeditions to Pamir Mountains and the border with Muslim caliphates
* After the fall of *Baekje and Goguryeo*, the new, Unified Silla's major concern was how to push the Tang army out of the Korean peninsula, which tried to stay and set up a Protectorate. The Tang Emperor's original intention was to create a Profectorate and to place the entire peninsula under Tang's rule.
* [A new Silla king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munmu_of_Silla), Kim Chun-chu's son and Kim Yu-sin's nephew, started a new war with Tang China. After about 7 years of struggle, the *Silla* army won a decisive victory against the Tang forces in the c[entral part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Maeso) of Korea. Losing interest, the Tang Emperor ordered withdrawal from the Korean peninsula. This is considered the major victory in the *Unified Silla*'s history
* King Munmu, who achieved this victory, was worshipped as a deity after his death. He famously left the words at his death bed ""**Cremate my remains and scatter the ashes in the sea** where the whales live. **I will become a dragon and thwart foreign invasion**"" - his ash was scattered from a rock islet that overlooks the East Sea/Sea of Japan.
   * Another legend says that King Munmu and the general Kim Yu-Sin (who was also worshipped as a deity in shamanism after death) appeared in the next king's dream and said: ""Blowing on a **bamboo flute** will calm the heavens and the earth."" After waking up, the king rode out to the sea, and indeed found a bamboo flute. It is said that the blowing of this bamboo flute invoked the spirits of King Munmu and General Gim Yu-sin and would push back enemy troops, cure illnesses, and bring and halt rain.

**Surviving poems from** ***Silla***

After the fall of *Baekje* and subsequent [fall of Goguryeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeon_Gaesomun#Death), *Silla*'s capital *Gyeongju (Gyerim)* in the southeastern part of Korea became the center of the old Koreanic culture

There are about 25 surviving *Silla* poems, written in some [Koreanized Chinese writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyangga) (e.g. Chinese writing system written in Korean word order with a few grammatical particles added)

* A common theme was the **moon, Buddhist serenity, Enlightenment, loss and grief**, and the beauty of nature
   * Moon is such a typical subject, there's even a movie titled ""The Moon Night of *Silla*"" (which is 90s' comedy though, lol)

This article provides great translations of these poems: [https://www.worldhistory.org/article/970/15-complete-hyangga-songs-from-ancient-korea/](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/970/15-complete-hyangga-songs-from-ancient-korea/) I'm just copying some of them here

>""**Prayer to Amitayus**""  
>  
>O moon, go to the West, and pray to Amitayus  
>  
>And tell that there is one who adotes the judicial throne,  
>  
>and longs for the Pure Land, praying before him with folded hands.  
>  
>Ah, would he leave me outstanding when he fulfills the forty-eight vows?

&#x200B;

>""**Requiem for the dead sister**""  
>  
>On the hard road of life and death that is near our land,  
>  
>You went, afraid, without words.  
>  
>We know not where we go  
>  
>Leaves blown, scattered, though fallen from the same tree, by the first winds of autumn.  
>  
>Ah, I will polish the path, until I meet you in the Pure Land.

&#x200B;

>""**Ode to Knight Kipa**""  
>  
>The moon that pushes her way through the thickets of clouds,  
>  
>Is she not pursuing the white clouds?  
>  
>Knight Kipa once stood by the water, reflecting his face in the Iro.  
>  
>Henceforth I shall seek and gather among pebbles the depth of his mind.  
>  
>Knight, you are the towering pine that scorns frost, ignores snow.

&#x200B;

>(part of a Buddhist poem)  
>  
>Ah, how happy is a moonlit autumn field, ripe with the fruit of knowledge.

'**Dedication of the Flower**' was sung by an old herdsman. One day the herdsman meets Lady Suro, wife of Lord Sunjong, and her entourage touring the countryside. The lady asks for an azealea flower growing on a high cliff, but the only person to respond is the herdsman. Giving Lady Suro the flower he sings:

>If you would let me leave the cattle tethered to the brown rock, and feel no shame for me,  
>  
>I would pluck and dedicate the flowers!

&#x200B;

""**Song of Choyong**"" is perhaps the most famous of all these *Silla* poems. The title character is the son of the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea who one night after a party returns home to find his **beautiful wife being seduced by the Spirit of Smallpox**. Choyong was forgiving, though, and in return, the spirit promised **never to enter a house which had a portrait of him** on the door. Choyong has been identified as a shaman, or an epidemic god. This is the song which Choyong sang so charmingly to the spirit so that he left in peace:

>Having caroused far into the night in the moonlit capital,  
>  
>I returned home and in my bed - Behold four legs  
>  
>Two were mine \*; Whose are the other two? (\* my wife's)  
>  
>Formerly two were mine; What shall be done now they are taken?

\[other myths\]

**The myth of a husband and wife drifted to Japan**

* In Gyeong-sang province (the Southeastern part of Korea; the original territory of *Silla*), there's a myth of a husband and wife being drifted on a mythical rock to Japan - the husband disappeared first, and then the wife discovered his shoes on the rock and got onto it, then the rock carried her to Japan too. Then they became the king and queen there. Silla lost the sun and moon when the couple disappeared into Japan. Later, the husband and wife (now the king and queen of Japan) sent a special silk cloth to Silla, so that Silla restores the sun and moon in the sky.

**The legend of the Emilee Bell**

* [The Bell of King Seongdeok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_of_King_Seongdeok), the largest bronze bell in Korea made in 765, has a legend that a child was sacrificed in its casting. >!The bell weirdly did not ring, but a Buddhist monk had a dream that if a child is thrown into its cast, the bell would ring. He took a baby from a nearby village and threw the child into the bronze cast - then the bell made the most beautiful sound ever!<.

**Seokguram grotto**

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtefactPorn/comments/eku5ze/statue\_of\_buddha\_and\_attendants\_inside\_seokguram/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtefactPorn/comments/eku5ze/statue_of_buddha_and_attendants_inside_seokguram/)
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seokguram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seokguram)
* This might be one of the most impressive Buddhist artefacts from the *Silla* era. However, when the Japanese tried to reconstruct it in the 20th century, they made a mistake of using concrete, which caused humidity problems that further damaged the site. There was a lot of rumor that the Japanese did that on purpose

**Stonemasons** 

* Stonemason skills were considered valuable in the Three Kingdoms and Silla period, with all the Buddhist art. Korean stonemasons often  humbly say ""each stone has its own sculpture in it, so I only carve it out that is already there"" 
   * Another legend: *Baekje* mason Asadal lost his wife while completing the tower of Bulguksa Temple in *Silla,* and that he committed suicide with the completion of the Buddha statue and pagodas 

**Magpies** 

* Magpies were a bird familiar with Korean people since ancient times, and the historical records of Three Kingdoms mention little myths about magpies. Many Buddhist temples in *Silla* housed magpies, and there are little legends about [Buddhist temples and magpies](https://encykorea-aks-ac-kr.translate.goog/Contents/Item/E0011213?_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=ko&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc), particularly magpies that repay the favor

&#x200B;

**Notable people from** ***Unified Silla***

* The reign of *Unified Silla* roughly corresponds with the reign of Tang Dynasty - the most **cosmopolitan** culture in Chinese history. Many **Sillans traveled to Tang China or even India**:
* Jang Bogo [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jang\_Bogo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jang_Bogo)
   * He was a Sillan peasant, and left for Tang China to pursue a career as a military official. Seeing that many Koreans were victims of slave trades, he formed a private navy of 10,000 men to **attack slavers**, leading to the Tang Emperor issuing an edict to stop slavery and return abducted Koreans to Silla. He returned to Silla as a successful general, and headquartered his powerful **private fleets in a southern island named Wando, near his hometown**. Unfortunately, his fame and power unsettled the nobility in Silla's capital, and they assassinated him when he tried to marry his daughter to the king.
      * He's still called ""Maritime King Jang Bogo""
* Choe Chi-won [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choe\_Chiwon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choe_Chiwon)
   * He was born as a nobility in Silla's capital, and was a child prodigy. However, under the Silla's micro-caste system (bone rank system), his caste was right below the highest ""True bone ranks"", which set a limitation on how far he could achieve. **His father sent him to Tang China**, saying if he doesn't pass the highest of Chinese civil service exam, he will not see him again. Choe indeed **became one of the highest officials in China**, but at the age of 28, he returned to Silla with the permission from the Tang Emperor, for his ageing parents. Later, he is remembered as one of the most important Korean Confucian scholars
* Wonhyo [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonhyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonhyo)
   * [https://www.worldhistory.org/Wonhyo/](https://www.worldhistory.org/Wonhyo/)
   * He was another prodigy and a Buddhist monk. He decided to **further his Buddhist study in Tang China**, and was leaving Korea. One night, he had traveled a long way and was very tired and thirsty. He **found what he thought as a cave and crawled in**. In the dark, his hand touched a **bowl that was full of rainwater**, and he drank it before going to sleep. When he woke up the next morning, he discovered that the 'bowl' was a decomposing **skull full of decaying old water** and that he had **slept in a tomb**.  He was shocked, vomited and ran from the tomb — that was when **enlightenment came**. Upon realizing that values of things depend on individual perception, he abandoned his trip to China (""now I got enlightenment, why should I go to China"") and returned his home Silla. His philosophy ""all is one and this one is empty"" influenced not only Korean, but also Chinese and Japanese Buddhism. He was also famous for **singing and dancing** in the street to spread his teaching to the mass 
   * His friend [Uisang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uisang), in contrast, finished elite education in China, and became the founder of Korean [Hwaeom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwaeom) school of Buddhism. He has a beautiful love story if anyone's interested 
* Hyecho [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyecho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyecho)
   * He's a Sillan Buddhist monk, and made a pilgrimage all the way to India. He wrote a travelogue titled ""Memoir of the **pilgrimage to the five kingdoms of India**"", containing a lot of information on the local diet, languages, climate, cultures, and political situations

\*\* “Park” “Kim” “Choi” are still the most common Korean surnames - and they originated from Silla

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Balhae: a multi-ethnic Northern kingdom**

* Soon after the fall of *Goguryeo*, a multi-ethnic kingdom named [Balhae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balhae) was founded by *Goguryeo* refugees and Tunguisc (Mohe) speakers in the modern day Manchuria/North Korea
* One of their poems/proses survives. It was written by a Balhae envoy in Japan, who heard the sound of his hometown at night
   * \* This poem is introduced in some Korean literature textbooks, that's how I know it
* This is beautiful, and sends you straight to an autumn night in 759

&#x200B;

>**I hear the sound of cloth-beating at night** \[夜聽擣衣聲\]  (759 AD)  
>  
>I was thinking of returning to my home country on an autumn night, and I heard a woman beating cloth in the neighborhood  
>  
>Hearing the sound of cloth-beating brings up all kinds of thoughts, I thought about who the woman was and why she was doing it late at night. Wondering whether her cloth-bat was heavy or whether it is flat, I even imagined a woman working with her fragile body, sweating fragrants  
>  
>Cloth-beating is a custom that does not exist in Japan. She might not be necessarily from Balhae, but she must be an immigrant from her own country, so when I heard her trimming clothes, I felt a sense of affinity and I thought of my homeland.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Fall of** ***Unified Silla***

* The reign of *Unified Silla* roughly corresponds to that of Tang Dynasty - when Tang collpased in 906, the economic and political system of *Unified Silla* got damaged as well. Their micro caste (bone rank) system could not absorb the political desire of the rising ruling class (called ""hojok"") in provinces
* Soon, some rebels proclaimed they're the successor of old *Baekje* and *Goguryeo*, and founded kingdoms in the old territories of those bygone countries
* This will put an end to what historans think of the ""ancient"" period of Korean history, opening up the new era of medieval Korea under [Goryeo dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goryeo) (which indeed borrowed its name from old *Goguryeo*)

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome.

Scranton, Company F, 128th USCT, on Charges of Miscegenation",120,x7jflu,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/x7jflu/the_courtmartial_and_dismissal_of_captain_edwin_j/,20,"Edwin J. Scranton enlisted in Company E of the 56th New York Infantry Regiment at Middletown, New York on July 16, 1861, at the age of twenty. Although enlisting in a New York Regiment, Scranton had been born in Connecticut in 1841. The regiment mustered into service on September 1, 1861, in New York City and Scranton was appointed as a Sergeant. The 56th served in defending Washing, D.C. until March of 1862 when it was assigned to the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, 4th Corps of the Army of the Potomac.

Scranton served with his regiment at the Siege of Yorktown, the Battle of Williamsburg, the Battle of Seven Pines, the Seven Days Battles, the Battle of Gaines’s Mill, the battle of Bottom’s Bridge, the Battle of White Oak Swamp, and the Battle of Malvern Hill. In July 1862 the regiment was assigned to Harrison’s Landing, where Scranton was promoted to First Sergeant of Company E before they were moved south where they participated in the Second Battle of Charleston in 1863.

On January 2, 1863, Scranton was commissioned a second lieutenant. He and the 56th continued to see action in South Carolina, fighting in the Battle of Honey Hill, the Battle of Tulifinny, the Battle of Deveaux’s Neck, and the Battle of Coosawatchie.

In late December 1864, the regiment was assigned to Morris Island, SC. While there, Scranton was given a commission as a Captain in the 128th United States Colored Troops. After Scranton’s transfer, the 56th New York would go on to serve in the Battle of Dingle’s Mill and on occupation duty until being Mustered out on October 17, 1865.

The 128th United States Colored Troops was organized at Hilton Head, S.C. in April of 1865. Scranton was placed as the commanding officer of Company F. During an inspection on the 21st of June, 1865 at Camp Stanton in Beaufort, Company F soldier Private John Greer refused to clean his weapon stating: “My gun is as clean as any man’s, and I’ll be damned if I clean it until I see the Colonel.” Scranton moved to arrest Greer with the assistance of Sergeant William Emory, and Greer tried to strike them. Greer was court-martialed and sentenced to three months of imprisonment and forfeiture of pay, time that he spent incarcerated at Fort Clinch, Florida.

During his time stationed in Beaufort with the 128th, Scranton began living with and later marrying a “colored woman of bad reputation”. Scranton was court-martialed on charges of miscegenation and sentenced to be discharged from the service. This verdict was upheld by Maj. Gen. Quincy Gilmore, in command of the Department of the South. Scranton was dismissed from the Service on September 7, 1865. Scranton is not the only white officer of the United States Colored Troops to marry a black woman. In January of 1866, a White Lieutenant named Thomas and his newlywed black bride returning to Ohio after his discharge were kicked off the steamboat Luminary on the Mississippi River and denied passage on another vessel.

Scranton and his wife, Ellen, raised four children in Connecticut until his death at 43 years old on July 19, 1884. Ellen would go on to apply for her husband’s pension in 1891, before taking on work as a live-in housekeeper, eventually dying in December of 1909 at the age of 67. Five years before her death, in 1904, Private John Smith of the United States Army Hospital Service station at Fort Mott, New Jersey had been discharged “for the good of the service” because of marrying a black woman. The discharge had been upheld by General Frederick Grant.

Later at school, students learn about the archeological relics of the culture, one surviving poem, and 3 surviving penal statues - which is often tested in the standardized state exams.

&#x200B;

**The foundation myth**:

(copied from [https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/61y8dw/koreas\_origin\_myth/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/comments/61y8dw/koreas_origin_myth/))

>... Hwanung, the son of the Emperor of Heaven, wished to descend from heaven and living the world of human beings. Knowing his son's desire, the Emperor of Heaven surveyed the three highest mountains and found Mount Taebaek the most suitable place for his son to settle and help human beings. ... Leading the Earl of Wind, the Master of Rain, and the Master of Clouds, he \[Hwanung\] took charge of some three hundred and sixty areas of responsibility, including agriculture, allotted life spans, illness, punishment, and good and evil, and brought culture to his people.  
>  
>At that time **a bear and a tiger** living in the same cave prayed to Holy Hwanung to transform them into human beings. The king gave them **a bundle of sacred mugworts and twenty cloves of garlic** and said, '**If you eat these and shun the sunlight for one hundred days**, you will assume human form.' Both animals ate the spices and avoided the sun. After twenty-one days **the bear became a woman**, but the tiger, unable to observe the taboo, remained a tiger. Unable to find a husband, the bear-woman prayed under the alter tree for a child. Hwanung metamorphosed himself, **lay with her, and begot a son called Dangun** Wanggeom (the mythical king of Korea).  
>  
>In the fiftieth year of the reign of Emperor Yao (one of China's mythological founders), Dangun made **the walled city of Pyongyang** (not the modern day city) the capital and **called his country Joseon**. He then moved his capital to Asadal on Mount Paegak ... he later hid in Asadal as a mountain god at the age of one thousand nine hundred and eight.

&#x200B;

**3 surviving penal statutes**:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight\_Prohibitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Prohibitions)

Chinese sources say that Gojoseon had 8 penal statutes called ""Eight Prohibitions."" Only 3 of them are known now.

* Those who commit murder shall be put to death immediately
* Those who cause injury must compensate with grain.
* Those who steal will be enslaved or pay recompense.

which draws an interesting parallel to the earliest penal codes from other cultures (e.g. The Code of Hammurabi).

(Source: Chinese source *The Book of Han*, written in 111)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Song <**My dear, don't cross the river** (Gongmudohaga 公無渡河歌)>

This is the only surviving poem from Gojoseon, passed down in a Chinese source <古今注> (written in 300 A.D.)

&#x200B;

>Dear, my dear, please don't cross that river  
>  
>Oh, my dear is now crossing the river  
>  
>Ah, he's drowned, he's gone  
>  
>What am I to do, what am I to do

&#x200B;

The Chinese source also tells a heartbreaking background story:

>One day a bargeman in Gojoseon was slowly rowing in the river. Then **a madman with grey hair walked into the river** with a bottle of liquor in his hand. His wife was chasing after him to stop him. He ignored her and kept going until **he was swept away, and drowned**. In despair, the wife took out her Gong-hu (a string instrument) and started singing. **The song was unspeakably sad**. Then **she followed her husband into the river and drowned**. The bargeman came back home and told his wife about this story and the song. She cried and sang the song with her Gong-hu, and everyone who heard the song shed tears.

&#x200B;

(Edit: there's a famous modern interpretation of this song by musician Lee Sang-eun [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1\_zYhn6bzR0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_zYhn6bzR0))

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Bronze daggers and dolmens**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoning\_bronze\_dagger\_culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoning_bronze_dagger_culture)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojoseon#Dolmen\_Tombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojoseon#Dolmen_Tombs)

The historical records of Gojoseon are supported by archaeological sites found in modern-day Manchuria and North Korea. The culture is characterized by large dolmen tombs and mandolin-shaped bronze daggers, among others.

* Traditional Korean folk culture has a strong shamanic element, and many people link this trait to **shamanism in Northern Asia and Siberia**. In some Korean regions shamans were called *Danggol*, similar to *Dangun* (the name of the god-king in the foundation myth). This is often interpreted as a cognate of *Tengri* (deity, god) in many Mongolic and Turkic cultures.

**The Fall of Gojoseon**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiman\_Joseon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiman_Joseon)

Around 200 BC, Wiman, a general from the Kingdom of Yan of northeastern China, took refuge in Gojoseon in the chaos of the collapse of Qin Dynasty in China. Later, WIman revolted and took over the kingdom.

About a hundred years later, China became reunified by Han Dynasty. In 109 BC, the Emperor Wu of Han invaded Wiman Joseon, destroyed it, and established the Four Commanderies of Han.

This triggered many Gojoseon refugees to migrate to the southern part of the Korean peninsula - **new Koreanic-kingdoms** such as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Baekje arose.

* In particular, the foundation myths of Buyeo (Manchuria), Goguryeo (Manchuria and Northern Korea), and Baekje (Central Korea) are interrelated.
   * The mythical founder of the **Buyeo** kingdom is Hae Mo-su (the son of heaven)
   * Jumong, the mythical founder of **Goguryeo**, was the son of Hae Mo-su and a daughter of a river god. Jumong was an exceptional archer, but his half-brothers got jealous of him. With the help of fishes and turtles that created a bridge for him, he escaped Buyeo and established a new kingdom.
      * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goguryeo#Jumong\_and\_the\_foundation\_myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goguryeo#Jumong_and_the_foundation_myth)
      * There's a k-drama called ***Jumong*** that first triggered a global interest in k-drama in the mid-2000s...
      * Also, Kim Il-sung created similar myths for his cult of personality...
   * When Jumong left Buyeo, he left his first son there. He had two other sons, Biryu and Onjo, with a new wife named Soseono in his new kingdom. He thought his first son was dead. But when his first son showed up, Jumong immediately made him the crown prince. After this, Jumong's wife Soseono left the kingdom, taking her two sons **southwards** for them to found their own kingdom. This is the origin story of **Baekje**.
      * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekje#Founding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baekje#Founding)

There are several hypotheses about who lived in the southern part of the Korean peninsula before this wave. One of the newest and most radical hypotheses I've heard is that Japonic languages had previously been spoken in the southern part of the peninsula, and these were replaced by the advance of Koreanic-speakers from the North ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular\_Japonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_Japonic)). Although this is a rising hypothesis among linguists, most Koreans haven't yet heard about that (and many will have emotional reactions to it).

* The consensus among linguists so far is that the Koreanic languages and Japonic languages did not originate from the same root. They instead came up with this replacement theory.

I understand that some kings and Emperors like Maximilian the first of HRE were not very good with stewardship but those are times were merchants were usually richer than kings and the large part of nobility struggled to adapt to the new economic realities. 

But what about the Hight medieval ages? For example king henry III of England had problems with money and he couldn't afford to launch an invasion to get the continental lands back form france, but then how could Richard the LionHeart sail with a rather large army to palestine? The kings didn't have an absolute power but they got taxes from all lands and this should accumulate into a  nice income that would allow them to have a medium sized private army.

I am specifically referring to infantry in this case, but it’s hard to tell even in general. In movies it’s usually this huge line of people with no organization whatsoever, whereas in video games you generally have different detachments of some hundreds of men you can move around.

418,Athrwys ap Meurig = the historical King Arthur?,836,x2epcz,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/x2epcz/athrwys_ap_meurig_the_historical_king_arthur/,104,"A theory about Arthur which I find really convincing is that he was identical to the person recorded in medieval texts as Athrwys ap Meurig.

Athrwys was a prince of south east Wales, and it seems that he eventually ruled over Gwent, Glywysing (basically Glamorgan) and Ergyng (encompassing parts of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire).

Many of the early Arthurian texts place Arthur in South Wales, south east in particular. For example, Caerleon is said to be his main court in some texts, and he is also associated strongly with Kerniw in early Welsh texts, which would match the region of Cernyw in south east Wales (a large region that may have actually been another name for Gwent).

So Athrwys lived and ruled in the same place in which Arthur lived and ruled according to much of the earliest information.

And regarding when he lived, it’s true that most modern authorities place Athrwys in the seventh century, 100 years after Arthur. But not all scholars agree. Some place him in the sixth century.

Here is some evidence for this: The Life of St Cadoc tells us that Tewdrig, the grandfather of Athrwys, was the great-great-grandfather of Cadoc. It is universally accepted that Cadoc was an early sixth century figure. Since Athrwys was two generations earlier in the family line, then even taking into account long gaps between children in the line from Tewdrig to Athrwys, Athrwys cannot possibly have lived later than the sixth century. Therefore, based on this information, he must have been a contemporary of Arthur.

So, he lived at the same time as Arthur and ruled the same location as Arthur. Surely, then, he was Arthur? The name ‘Athrwys’ appears variously as ‘Arthwys’ and ‘Arthrwys’, and these could all quite plausibly be corruptions of the Latin form ‘Arthurus’.

Additionally, the family of Athrwys matches the legendary family of Arthur is various ways: 

- Arthur’s sister Anna (*HRB*) matches Athrwys’ sister Anna.

- Arthur’s maternal uncle Gwrfoddw Hen (*Culhwch ac Olwen*) matches Athrwys’ likely maternal uncle Gwrfoddw, king of Ergyng. 

- Arthur’s sons Morgan and Adeluf (*Le Petit Bruit*) match Athrwys’ sons Morgan and Ithel. 

- Arthur’s brother Madoc (*Dialogue of Arthur and Eryr*) matches Athrwys’ likely brother Madoc Morfryn.

- Arthur’s son Gwydr (*Culhwch ac Olwen*) may well match Gwrhitir, the possible son of Athrwys (he was either the son of Athrwys or the son of Morgan ap Athrwys).

- Arthur’s relative (possibly his maternal uncle) Iaen (*Culhwch ac Olwen*) likely matches Athrwys’ maternal uncle Ieuan. 

- Arthur’s father Uther Pendragon (*HRB*) matches Tewdrig, the grandfather of Athrwys, whose career matches Uther Pendragon in many key ways. And like Uther, he died when Athrwys was young. 

- Arthur’s cousin, an unnamed Irish king (*Life of St Padarn* if I’m not mistaken) matches King Brychan, the Irish cousin of Athrwys. 

The family of Athrwys is also known to have intermarried with the royal family of King Budic over in Brittany, which is the same dynasty that Arthur’s family intermarries with in the legends.

Edit: Most of these familial connections can be found in *King Arthur: The Man Who Conquered Europe*, by Caleb Howells.",1661955236.0,2022-08-31 14:13:56+00:00

Not for the faint of heart.
* When I first read the history of Unit 731, what shocked and disturbed me almost as much as the Unit's horrible actions was that General MacArthur and the U.S. government pardoned the members of Unit 731 despite the horrendous atrocities they committed. 
* The main reason the Unit 731 members were pardoned was the U.S. did not want any other country to get its hands on the data and results of the Unit's biological experiments, as well as the fact that the U.S. knew that they would never be able to get the results from conducting their own experiments, as the Japanese were only able to get their data from performing lethal experiments on thousands of prisoners they took during the war.
* But from what I have researched, the results of Unit 731's experiments were neither groundbreaking nor even practical for most purposes. 

1. So what exactly did the U.S. consider to be so valuable that they were willing to let these monsters go unpunished?
2. Was the U.S. aware of the full extent and nature of the Unit's crimes when they pardoned them? 
3. Although this idea may come across as pretty dark, I feel that in this case, it is fully deserved, and that idea is that the U.S. would tell the Unit 731 members they would pardon them, and once they got the data, they would just execute them after.

Is that really true though? Does such a concept not discount the continued existence of the Byzantines? What about the Muslim Golden Age, which developed much of it's knowledge from foundations set by Classical scholars?

But I've always had a soft spot for personal/anecdotal popular history, and none have impressed me as much as books like Erik Larson's The Devil in the White City and In the Garden of Beasts, and Ben McIntyre's Agent Zigzag and Double Cross. 

Both of these authors have a taste for the quirky and peculiar details -- I really enjoy this approach. Both maintain a sense of humour throughout, which can be hard when you're writing about Nazis and serial killers. But they pull it off. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for popular historical non-fiction in the vein of Larson and McIntyre?",1661531801.0,2022-08-26 16:36:41+00:00
444,What Makes a Mountain Historically Sacred? One Common Characteristic,20,wybzhu,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/wybzhu/what_makes_a_mountain_historically_sacred_one/,6,"To the Ancient Greeks, [Mt. Olympus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Mytikas.jpg) was the home of the gods, the birthplace of legends. For all they knew, Mt. Olympus could very well have been the tallest mountain in the world, as there weren't any mountains nearby that were nearly as high. Nowadays, we know that Mt. Olympus, with an elevation of 2917 m, is less than one-third the height of the tallest mountain on Earth—Mt. Everest—which has an elevation of 8849 m. Perhaps if the Ancient Greeks had seen the Alps or Himalayas, they would have thought differently.

Throughout history, numerous mountains around the world have been regarded as sacred by local populations. In biblical allusions, [Mt. Ararat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Mount_Ararat_and_the_Yerevan_skyline_in_spring_%2850mm%29.jpg/1920px-Mount_Ararat_and_the_Yerevan_skyline_in_spring_%2850mm%29.jpg) (elev: 5137 m) is held to be the landing site of Noah's Ark. To the Ancient Chinese, [Huangshan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Huangshan_pic_4.jpg) (elev: 1864 m) is seen as the place where the Yellow Emperor created the Pills of Immortality. In the San Francisco Bay Area, [Mt. Diablo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/View_of_Mount_Diablo_and_CA_Highway_24_from_Lafayette_Heights.jpg) is regarded by the Miwok and Ohlone Tribes as the creation point of the world, despite its relatively low elevation of 1173 m.

None of these mountains are even remotely close to being the tallest in the world. Yet, they all have one thing in common: they are ***dominant points***. The definition of a dominant point is quite simple:

Imagine you're standing at the summit (the highest point) of Mt. Olympus. Let the *horizon* at the summit refer to the flat plane that intersects the summit, to which the direction of gravity at the summit is perpendicular to. In other words, the horizon represents your flat eye-level when you're standing at the summit. Something is *above the horizon* of the summit if it's on the side of this plane that is opposite of the direction of gravity. In other words, when you're standing at the summit, you'll have to look above your flat eye-level to see a point that is above your horizon.

A point on Earth's surface is a ***dominant point*** if nothing on the planet rises above the horizon of that point. Standing at a dominant point, nothing rises above your horizon. You are *on top of the world*.

For instance, Mt. Olympus is a dominant point because nothing rises above your horizon when you're standing at its summit. Sure, [Mt. Etna](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Mt_Etna_and_Catania1.jpg) in Italy may have a higher elevation of 3357 m, but Mt. Etna is so far away from Mt. Olympus that due to Earth's curvature, the summit of Mt. Etna is approximately 30 km *below* the horizon of Mt. Olympus. (Sorry, flat-Earthers!)

Meanwhile, [Twin Peaks](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Twin_Peaks-San_Francisco.jpg) (elev: 282 m) in San Francisco is not a dominant point because there are higher mountains nearby that rise above the horizon of its summit, including Mt. Diablo, which rises over 700 m above its horizon. As expected, Twin Peaks does not have the same sacred status as Mt. Diablo, which is a dominant point.

Why are so many sacred mountains dominant points? It turns out that back in the day, when knowledge of distant lands was limited, a local mountaintop that feels like the top of the world may as well be thought of as the tallest mountain in the world, lending it divine significance.

That's not to say that all sacred mountains are dominant. Many non-dominant mountains are held sacred for their unique shape or other subjective factors, as is the case for [Mt. Kailash](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Kailash_north.JPG/1920px-Kailash_north.JPG) (elev: 6714 m) in Tibet or [Uluru](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Uluru_%28Helicopter_view%29-crop.jpg) (elev: 863 m) in Australia. But ultimately, a dominant mountain has a much greater likelihood of being sacred, and a sacred mountain has a remarkable chance of being dominant.

Perhaps to our ancestors, being on top of the world, after all, was the closest that one can get to the heavens.

Yet, Lisbon and Madrid still kept very much of a command economy and didn't allow many foreign investors go in and have at it with their cities. This is totally in contrast with the Republic of Venice and Duchy of Milan which received plenty of foreign money, and tourists, together with Austrian backing.

It is well-known in Korea that the former dictator Park Chung-hee banned color television broadcast. It was only in 1980, after Park's assassination, when color television broadcast was permitted in South Korea. 

Most English articles I found say that Park was concerned about the social incongruity between the rich (who will own the color TVs) and poor would exacerbate.

However, some Koreans say that color TV just did not suit the aesthetic sense of Park - his stoic, militaristic taste (he's a guy who grew up with Japanese imperialist militaristic value). He preferred the aesthetics of black-and-white.

With the end of Reconstruction, the former Confederate states of America experienced a snapback to the bad old days. The planter aristocracy that had ruled much of the region prior to 1860 regained their power, blacks were terrorized and beaten into political nonexistence, and thereafter the region was preserved in amber until MLK Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement came along to help destroy Jim Crow. 

[This paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22184/w22184.pdf) argues for a much more nuanced look on the assertion that planters of the antebellum south remained in power. For sure, there was a re-entrenchment for some old slave holders and plantation owners.

483,Why was France so ineffective in taking the Flemish cities as opposed to Maximilian I?,37,wnu65m,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/wnu65m/why_was_france_so_ineffective_in_taking_the/,8,"Philip IV desperately wanted Bruges, Ghent, Ypres, and the other Flemish towns, and he indeed managed to get some chunks, which is why Lille, Douai, and Bethune go over to the French crown. 

Later we get Louis X who decides to hit them with sanctions and cut grain exports, and this further complicates things and by the 1320s, we are getting revolt after revolt, then an intensity of the Hundred Years War between France and England and we have Flanders become part of the estates of the Duke of Burgundy, some call it the Burgundian State or the Burgundian Circle. 

When the duke, Charles the Bold, dies, the French king, Louis XI, starts attacking and this prompts Mary of Burgundy, the daughter of the old duke, to marry the Habsburg, Maximilian.

And when we get to the age of Maximilian I, he goes over them and puts down a revolt against his rule and he does it so brilliantly that Bruges is finally weakened and the trade metropolis to come atop is Antwerp. 

But Bruges, together with Ghent and Ypres, put one hell of a fight against the French kings and their puppet governors. What made Maximilian and the new Habsburg dynasty able to take Flanders and establish dominance there so easily compared to the French kings who were always struggling?",1660440902.0,2022-08-14 01:35:02+00:00

It was quite an interesting period. I mean this was when there was when the most prominent cities in the low countries were Antwerp and Bruges as opposed to the Hague and Amsterdam.

But eventually, it goes to Vienna for control yet they're very slow with beefing it up, and the Dutch just keep obsessing over ""defense"" all the time and never really forge a strong tie with the emperor. In the entire 1700s, Flanders is a sitting duck for British blockades and French invasions.

So when Louis XV goes to war with Austria as an ally of Frederick of Prussia, he invades the Austrian Netherlands and scoops up all these towns.

But if we recall, the Austrian Netherlands or Habsburg low countries, whatever you wish to call them, had struggles with their Ostend Company, which was laughed at by the English East India Company and the Dutch East India Company. Not to mention they didn't really have anything in the west.

The best bankers of the day were no longer in Antwerp and Bruges, they were up in Amsterdam and London. Not even art and music were really of much talk, as they had been in previous centuries.

So why did Austria neglect poor little Flanders like this? They were the cash cow of the Habsburg family.",1660123682.0,2022-08-10 09:28:02+00:00
490,Why did Truman drop the atomic bombs on Japan despite the protests of his military commanders?,0,wm59d5,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/wm59d5/why_did_truman_drop_the_atomic_bombs_on_japan/,86,"This week marks the 75th anniversary of the world’s first nuclear attacks. On August 9, 1945, the US dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Nagasaki. It took the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Those caught in the center were instantly turned into dust, while countless others died from the burns and high doses of radiation they received.

*“If we’d lost the war, we’d all have been prosecuted as war criminals.”* So said Curtis LeMay, the US air force chief of staff who had directed the assault over Japan in the final days of the Second World War.

LeMay was not alone in his verdict. *“We had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages,”* Fleet Admiral William Leahy, chair of the chiefs of staff under both presidents Roosevelt and Truman, wrote in his autobiography.

Some Americans still argue today that nuking Japan was necessary to avoid more casualties during the land invasion. But few people know that top US generals, including future president Dwight D. Eisenhower, actually opposed the move.

*""The Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing,""* said Eisenhower. He called the bombings *""completely unnecessary""* and *“no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives.”*

In fact, most Allied military leaders did not see the necessity for the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Chester W Nimitz, the commander in chief of the US Pacific fleet, insisted that they were *""of no material assistance* *in our war against Japan.”*

Another US General and a supreme commander of the southwest Pacific area, Douglas MacArthur also saw ""*no military justification* *for the dropping of the bomb.”*

So, if it wasn't to save Americans' lives then why did actually Truman bomb Japan despite his generals opposing the move?

Was it to test the new weapon or to flex muscles?

Do you believe that Washingron would be found guilty of war crimes if America wasn't among the victors of the Second World War?",1660259598.0,2022-08-11 23:13:18+00:00

TIL one of their strikes triggered a series of events that ultimately led to Park's assassination

1. Working condition of female workers in the 60s\~70s

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women\_factory\_workers\_in\_South\_Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_factory_workers_in_South_Korea)

[https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english\_edition/e\_national/969735.html](https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/969735.html)

* The workers, often daughters of peasant families who migrated to Seoul from poorer rural areas, were horribly treated in general. For example
   * Forced injection of **amphetamine** to work for extremely long hours
      * Basically what's happening in North Korea nowadays
   * Naked **body search**
      * Can't find a source right now but I remember an old female labor activist's interview that mentioned this. Naked body search was done to prevent these workers from stealing anything from the factory. Sometimes the search was done by male overseers.
   * **Routine sexual harassment** and assaults
      * Things like a male overseer groping breasts happened on a daily basis
* Many suffered from tuberculosis and other diseases
   * These women worked like this to send money to their family. This money was often **used to educate sons** (oppas and nam-dong-saengs) in the family
* As there was extreme forms of abuse, extreme forms of protests also happened. In 1975, young female workers at Dong-il Textile protested naked, in the hope that the male police will not be able to handle their naked bodies, only to be cruelly cracked down.
   * Jeon Tae-il, the legendary labor activist who died of self-immolation, basically died for these female workers [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeon\_Tae-il](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeon_Tae-il)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim\_Young-sam#House\_arrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Young-sam#House_arrest)

* With this context, female workers at a wig-exporting company called YH Trading protested against the closure of their factory
   * the then-**opposition party leader Kim Young-sam** ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim\_Young-sam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Young-sam), later elected as President in 1993) allowed them to use the headquarters of his New Democratic Party as a place for their sit-in demonstration
   * 1,000 riot police raided the place, and **a 21-year-old woman was killed** in the process
   * This incited criticism against Park's dictatorship

&#x200B;

3. Park's persecution of Kim Young-sam (October 1979)

* Park Chung-hee (dictator) decided to remove YS from politics. The South Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) worked on that.
   * YS was **expelled from** the National Assembly in October 1979
   * **all 66 lawmakers of the New Democratic Party resigned** from the National Assembly as a protest

&#x200B;

4. Bu-Ma (Busan-Masan) Democratic Protests (October 1979)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu-Ma\_Democratic\_Protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu-Ma_Democratic_Protests)

* **Uprisings broke out** in Kim Young-sam's hometown Busan, and it spread to nearby Masan
   * Police stations, the Korea Broadcasting System station, and the Busan tax office were destroyed, for example
   * Martial law was declared and the military arrested more than 1,000 people

&#x200B;

5. Banquet at a secret house inside Blue House (Oct 26, 1979)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination\_of\_Park\_Chung-hee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Park_Chung-hee)

* In the midst of this turmoil, Park Chung-hee drank with his KCIA chiefs at a **banquet** at a secret house (called ""An-ga,"" ""inside house"") inside the Blue House.
   * It is well-known that a popular female singer Shim Su-bong was singing at the banquet
* They started discussing the Bu-Ma uprising
   * Then a hardliner KCIA guy suggested ""we should just **mow them down with tanks**""
      * In another source I remember, he actually said ""**the world hadn’t blinked an eye when 3 million people were slaughtered in Cambodia. We could get away with killing 1-2 million**.""
      * (an English source: [https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english\_edition/english\_editorials/1033401.html](https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/english_editorials/1033401.html))
   * Park Chung-hee praised him for saying that.
* This really upset his moderate political rival, Kim Jae-gyu ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim\_Jae-gyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jae-gyu)), at KCIA.
   * There was an existing rivalry between these two KCIA guys, but as far as I remember, what really triggered Kim Jae-gyu was this Cambodia remark, and the fact that Park Chung-hee sided with it.

&#x200B;

6. Kim Jae-gyu assassinates Park Chung-hee

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim\_Jae-gyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jae-gyu)

* Kim left the banquet room, and convened his closest subordinates, saying ""Today is the day.""
* He reentered the room with a pistol and **shot Park in the right chest.** He also killed the KCIA guy who tried to flee the scene.
   * In the meantime, Kim's subordinates held President's bodyguards at gunpoint, and eventually killed them. Overall, six people were killed at the banquet.

I remember reading somewhere an historian's estimation that, in the past 3500 or so years of human history, we had seen only 268 in which no major armed conflicts were known to have been fought around the world. Only thing is, that estimation didn't include any details of *specific* years.

I thought it'd be fun to see how many years we could find in global history where there was credible evidence of peace.

Rules as follows:

* Starting from 1500 BC, records previous to this are too sparse for even reasonably accurate mapping
* A 'Peace Year' can include a year during which a 'low intensity conflict' was nominally in progress (e.g. Isles of Scilly vs. Netherlands, Caste War of Yucatan, Unif. of Saudi Arabia) so long as *no major engagement* in said conflict occurred during that year
* Skirmishes and extremely localised conflicts do not count for the purposes of this exercise unless they can be said to have direct impact on subsequent military events (i.e. unless they led in some way to a war). Small one-off bouts ('handbags' as we call them in Britain) can occur in a Peace Year.
* Pogroms and state-mandated, systematic persecutions cannot occur in a Peace Year. Customary/legal allowance of what we now consider 'barbaric practices' may occur in a Peace Year for the purpose of not making the exercise totally redundant, as those activities occurred almost everywhere to some degree until very recently, even though their inclusion does somewhat cheapen the idea of a 'Peace Year'

515,How didn't several islands in the westernmost of Japan (Ryukyu Islands) either transferred or handed over to the Republic of China (Taiwan) after WWII?,12,weiafc,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/weiafc/how_didnt_several_islands_in_the_westernmost_of/,8,"In the brevity historical reference, the U.S and R.O.C officials discussed each other with small mentioned on several islands of westernmost Japan should be given a gift to the Republic of China's territory. There was a conspiracy several or many months before the end of WWII about the unresolved fate of the Ryukyu Islands.

According to author Robert D. Eldridge, President Truman asks R.O.C Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek about the voluntarily joint administration of the Ryukyu Islands after Japan surrenders to the Allies to safeguard the terrified civilians. Chiang replies, ""China would be agreeable to joint occupation of the Ryukyus by China and the United States and, eventually, joint administration by the two countries under the trusteeship of an international organization."" But due to complicating deal, the R.O.C dropped the pretension to join the occupation of the Ryukyu Islands. It didn't want to offend the R.O.C forces to pretense permanently staying in the Ryukyu Islands as allegedly eliminating the Japanese culture. We may be concerned about the violation of the U.N Charter. Therefore, the Ryukyu Islands were temporarily administered by the U.S post-WWII.

In conclusion, Chiang and his representatives declined the offer of military occupation ""that neither the Minister for Foreign Affairs nor any other part of the Chinese Government contemplated their return to China in a peace settlement.""

The overall negotiation about the Ryukyu Islands talks through during the 1943 Cairo Conference.

529,1800s Power to UK Mansion House,304,w7fzi9,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/w7fzi9/1800s_power_to_uk_mansion_house/,59,"I am trying to find images or drawings of how mansion houses were powered in the 1800s and early 1900s (pre 1920) and hoping someone can source it for me, as despite me searching cannot find anything, maybe I am using wrong keywords but maybe someone else can have luck.

Basically the place I am trying to research has a mansion house in rural scotland and half a mile away from that was a building called ""Battery Shed"" and ""Engine Shed"", the engine shed had some sort of engine/fly wheel/dynamo on a large concrete block and next door was a place that has the battery cells and accumulator.

It is presumed the engine powered the battery cells and the power from them was fed to the mansion house to supply the 110v power supply.

As to what kind of generator/engine was used that is the big unknown question, but I did see that Cragside has a very similar looking Power House building and the generator/cells could be similar. But unlike cragside the mansion house i am investigating does not have a hydropower setup

There was however a private water supply fed to the house from a large circular water tank on side of hill (another half mile away from that engine building) so there is a possibility that may have been used to power the generator/engine but as to how that could have been done is unknown. (the location of mansion house was not near a river or running water, so conventional power wheel would not be used)

it is a large round tank, 7 Meters in height, 6 meters water height, 14 meters in diameter, [https://imgur.com/a/s5xUth6](https://imgur.com/a/s5xUth6) going by the size of the tank it would seem a bit excessive for just water to the mansion house, thats why i am thinking it may have had something to do with the generator, but how that would have been done is a mystery that I am trying to find out.

If it was not water how could this engine/generator have been powered, obviously coal is an option but nothing suggests that may have been used, and the same with has nothing suggests a facility or gasometer on site.

Water was fed into the tank from nearby hills and water fed to mansion house and associated buildings by quite large cast iron pipes so certainly the tank was used more than just for mansion house toilet and sink supply.

So taking everything into account the round water tank seems to be the key object of use.

So has anyone seen anything like this setup in images/drawings/plans? either engine/generator and/or batteries?

This is layout plan of the building in question

[https://imgur.com/AWCbp99](https://imgur.com/AWCbp99)

Power may not have been got from the power grid until early 1940s so taking that into account then batteries/generator may have powered house but its the how would generator have been powered that is baffling me.

To have a power house and battery cells obviously was important. I just cannot figure out how it was powered and this is why I need some other input from others as they may know something i would not know.

1, flat roof

2. battery house/shed

3. engine house/shed

4. open area full length and height but no access to both sheds except hole in wall size of large fist  where flywheel pole passed through

No substantial records of women warriors, too. Theodora and Irene of Athens came close to being powerful, but we all know that historians in their times are very, very critical to Irene for wanting to be more than an Empress for the same reason why Charlemagne and HRE formed.

Oh and feel free to zoom in to whichever part you are most interested in, as this post is certainly not the shortest post out there…

# Part 1: Liu Bang’s (刘邦) rise to power from a peasant to the Emperor of China

**Introduction:** In 221 BCE, when the Qin dynasty unified China, the world breathed a huge sigh of relief. War was finally over, and with the unification of China, peace and prosperity would finally come… Unfortunately, Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇), the first emperor of China died after only 11 years of rule (some sources say he died of unknowingly self-inflicted mercury poisoning, other sources say he was assassinated). With the death of Qin Shi Huang, the centralized government that kept the empire together, shattered. Nobles forged letters that they claimed had been written by the emperor before his death, telling the heir of the throne to commit suicide, puppet emperors were installed and replaced many times by other puppet emperors; TLDR, China was a total mess, again…

**Rise of the rebels:** The nobles were fighting to fill the power vacuum that Qin Shi Huang’s death left, and so nobody was paying attention when two peasants Chen Sheng (陈胜) and Wu Guang (吴广) rose up in the province of Henan (河南), starting the Dazexiang (大泽乡) rebellion. The Qin dynasty rule was based on harsh punishments and fear by the peasant population, but the enforcement needed the might of an army, but the Qin government lacked an army led by a powerful leader. The ensuing chaos caused multiple other rebellions to spring up all around the country.  One of those rebelling peasants was Liu Bang (刘邦), a peasant who had simply gone with the flow of events and decided to join the revolt. Joining an army of peasants, Liu Bang quickly rose up the ranks, even allegedly becoming friends and ""brothers""\* with Xiang Yu (项羽), a powerful noble from the state of Chu who was a prominent candidate to become the next emperor of China. As time passed, the imperial court finally started calming down, and a eunuch named Zhao Gao (赵高) successfully took control (according to some sources, he was the one who had Qin Shi Huang assassinated). He ""inherited"" an empire in flames (congrats…). As the Qin government's internal issues were finally “solved” (not really), they sent army after army trying to quash the rebellion.

**War against the Qin:** The rebel forces under king Huai of Chu (楚怀王), realizing that they wouldn’t last fighting against the Qin dynasty armies, decided that the rebellion had to strike at the heart of the empire and take the capital of the Qin dynasty, Xianyang (咸阳). To incentivize his people, king Huai informed his followers, that whoever took the capital first would become the king of the region of Guanzhong (关中). This caused a rivalry between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu.  Because Xiang Yu was bogged down by the army of Qin (which was significantly larger than his, but he still won, defying all odds), Liu Bang reached and took the capital first (at that point, one of Zhao Gao’s puppet emperors killed Zhao Gao and surrendered to Liu Bang). Xiang Yu was furious; he buried all the 200,000\*\* soldiers of the Qin dynasty that had surrendered to him alive and marched towards Xianyang. Xiang Yu had 400,000 troops while Liu Bang only had 100,000 troops, Liu Bang was going to be decimated, unless… When Xiang Yu entered the city of Xianyang, Liu Bang allegedly groveled before him and convinced Xiang Yu that he was loyal and not a threat, narrowly avoiding death in the “Feast at Swan Goose Gate (鸿门宴)”.

**The fall of Xiang Yu’s empire:** Having gained power after multiple victories vs the Qin, Xiang Yu became more and more powerful, slowly making King Huai (the figurehead of the rebellion) his puppet, essentially becoming emperor in everything but name. After successfully defeating the Qin government, the empire was divided into eighteen parts. One of the less attractive regions (nowadays Sichuan, 四川) was given to Liu Bang who slowly regained his strength. One of the reasons why the empire that Xiang Yu created failed, was that many of the dukes controlling the different regions were unhappy with the amount of territory they were given, as Xiang Yu was unwilling to give much power to them.  This led to the same type of situation as during the Qin dynasty: The nobility wanting more power from the centralized government, fighting and plotting to destroy the regime and become king themselves. Finally, the death of King Huai in 206 BCE, whether assassinated by Xiang Yu or not, caused the feudal lords who accused Xiang Yu of murder to rebel. This group of rebelling states led by Liu Bang defeated Xiang Yu, using sheer numbers and good generals (though it took many tries, as Liu Bang lost fight after fight against Xiang Yu), finally installing Liu Bang as emperor, who astutely was more willing to share his power in order to reign over China, changing Chinese history forever.  Fun fact: Chinese Chess (象棋), a game played by millions in China, depicts one part of this war, where Xiang Yu and Liu Bang make peace, deciding to split the empire in half. Of course, Liu Bang broke the peace immediately and attacked Xiang Yu while he wasn’t ready, leading to his eventual defeat (though Xiang Yu made many heroic stands).

**The first large-scale peasant revolts and why they happened:** Before the Qin dynasty, unlike the later widespread dissent from the nobility and the peasants, there were few large-scale peasant uprisings in China, with changes in dynasties rather being caused by feuds between different tribes and their nobility. Once we reach the Qin dynasty though, large-scale peasant rebellions occurred, becoming a frequent issue in the collapse of most future Chinese dynasties. From my point of view (tell me if I’m wrong), two of the main reasons why there were so many peasant revolts in the Qin dynasty (and afterwards) are urbanization (high population concentration), and economic instability for the peasantry, caused by high taxation on top of land issues (talked about more in part 3). Though China only started seriously urbanizing in the 21st century, there is a noticeable difference in the levels of urbanization between the start and the end of the Zhou dynasty. This is because of the advancements in trade, causing the start of the early silk road, and improving inland trade using the rivers of China around 600 BCE. Furthermore, these advances in trade and the growth of the population caused increasing urbanization (as people didn’t have to be on farmland, secluded, instead making a living off creating other products and selling them). Due to urbanization, people were more likely to rebel as they could share dissent with so many of their comrades and watched others suffer and die. Indeed, as communication became easier, not only were large-scale revolts easier to be sparked, but they also gained traction faster, which could sometimes make the difference between a small revolt that was crushed in its tracks, and a revolt that destroyed a nation.

# Part 2: The rise of Confucianism, and changes in governance

**Introduction:** After defeating Xiang Yu at the battle of Gaixia (垓下), forming the Han dynasty, Liu Bang and his descendants would try to stabilize the empire, dealing with the threats inside.

**The resurgence of feudalism:** With the establishment of the Han dynasty, Liu Bang had to fulfill all the promises he made to his loyal generals and advisors. He also had to manage power dynamics of the different nobles, to keep them from revolting and causing Liu Bang to suffer the same fate as Xiang Yu. As he had promised, Liu Bang reestablished the feudal system of the Zhou Dynasty, giving the land to his loyal followers (one common misconception from my understanding, is that Liu Bang feoffed the land to the Liu family members, whom he could trust. In fact, these supposed “relatives” only gained the Liu title after taking control of a state as to have the legitimacy to govern a state). Liu Bang kept around 50% of the Chinese lands that he had not given out, and instead implemented the Qin dynasty's system: The “Prefectures and Counties system (郡县制)”. Essentially this system divided the empire into certain provinces, and those provinces would be governed by governors sent out by the imperial court (the higher positions were chosen by the emperor, the lower ones were chosen by other officials). Unfortunately, the feudal system of the Zhou dynasty had many issues, as the level of autonomy of the feudal states was very high, each one even having its own laws and army, leading to many issues later on in the empire.

**Tug of war between the feudal lords and the emperors:** For the next few centuries of Han rule, because of the power of the nobility and the decentralization of the government, Han rulers tried to take back more power while the nobility tried to gain more autonomy. This led to many wars and feuds between the nobility and the emperors. One famous example of such a revolt was in 154 BCE, where Emperor Jing (汉景帝) divided the provinces into smaller chunks as to minimize the power of the nobility. This led to 7 out of the 12 feudal lords rebelling against the emperor, fighting ferociously yet still losing in only 3 months in the “Rebellion of the Seven States (七国之乱)”, causing China to stay united. This event slowly lead to the “victory” by the emperors of the Han dynasty over the nobility and the gradual decline of a feudal system in favor of the “Prefectures and Counties (郡县制)” system of the Qin dynasty, with all provinces being converted to the latter system by 100 BCE. With “total” power and a centralized government, emperors like Han Wudi (汉武帝) and Han Xuandi (汉宣帝) finally brought a golden age in Chinese history, establishing the silk road and expanding the empire (I will talk about the silk road in detail in part 4) .

**Stabilizing the Empire/The rise of Confucianism:** While Confucianism (儒家) emerged in the Spring and Autumn period (春秋时期), Confucianism only rose to prominence in the Han dynasty (before that Confucius was popular with the populace but not with the nobility). In fact, during the lifetime of Confucius, he had little to no success in government circles, becoming a fugitive over and over, having to escape many civil wars. In an environment where warfare ability was of paramount importance, the ideas of Confucius had very little noticeable effect and struggled to find traction. So the question is what changed during the Han dynasty that made Confucianism popular and even the ""state religion"" of the Han dynasty? Emperor Liu Bang’s humble origins made him lack a certain authority. According to the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies: “The prevailing conception of the ruler of “all-under-Heaven"" at the time was that he must be a man of noble origin, or a man ordained by Heaven, or a man of great wisdom and virtue. Liu Bang was not of noble birth, nor was he, to quote his own words, ""a man of wisdom and virtue.” ” Therefore, to solve the issue of legitimacy, Liu Bang went to great lengths to make the populace believe that he was indeed “ordained by heaven”, and that is when he and his descendants turned to Confucianism. It is important to note though, that the version of “Confucianism” that came about in the Han dynasty was slightly different than the ideals that Confucius had a few centuries earlier, as Confucianism had slightly changed over time with different advocates adding ideas from Taoism, legalism, and the five elements (a philosophical system of the “Warring States 战国时期” period).

# Part 3: The economy of the Han dynasty

This topic is way too complex and nuanced to summarize, as it is not static in the 400 years of Han rule and changed over time, so these are from my understanding some basic points:

1. Population growth in the Han dynasty: The rapid rise of the population (the population reached over 60 million in the Han dynasty) because of the development of agricultural technology was a two-sided blade, as it caused many administrative issues and made the country harder to govern. Many people also starved as the food production was not catching up with the country's needs. In the Zhou dynasty, land was a lot easier to come by, as the Zhou dynasty was expanding rapidly into neighboring tribes faster than the population could grow. The situation was kind of the same as in America, where you could go to an empty patch of land and simply claim it, with no one caring. Once we reach the Han dynasty though, this changes, with the demand for land becoming higher, while the supply stayed relatively the same.
2. Land control in the Han dynasty: As I mentioned in my previous post about the Qin dynasty, during the Warring States period, due to the reforms of Shang Yang, land could be bought and sold freely. This resulted in generations of wealthy landowners growing their land base over hundreds of years, acquiring lands from small landowners that had fallen into debt. According to Chan Cuo, an official of the Han dynasty, the average landowning family of 5 people was at high risk of falling into debt in the circumstance of natural disasters or due to high taxation. Many emperors like emperor Ai (汉哀帝) attempted to limit the amount of land the nobility could amass, but failed as emperors (especially in the Eastern Han dynasty) relied heavily on the wealthy aristocracy to secure their position as emperor. The issue with this concentration of land under a few landowning families was that it caused even more power to accumulate in the hands of a few individuals, and it caused peasants to be even poorer.
3. Tax Reforms: To try and stop the main tax base of the peasant landowners from falling into debt and handing over their land to the nobility, and to simply help the peasant population survive, the Han dynasty continuously lowered taxes in times of instability (i.e. natural disasters). Sometimes, the land/agricultural tax was even suspended. Therefore, during periods of increased capital needs (e.g. in the case of a war), the Han dynasty would have to raise taxes on the merchants and the nobility (e.g. increasing property and poll tax, or nationalizing a certain industry). During the reign of Han Wudi, when he needed to fill the national treasury to wage his wars, he sold titles, which became a trend especially in the Eastern Han dynasty, making the government increasingly corrupt and out of talent.

# Part 4: Han golden age/The silk road

**Introduction:** As the Han dynasty gradually centralized its power, the emperors could finally dare to start making radical changes with a more manageable risk of being overthrown. Han Wudi (汉武帝) was the first of these “powerful” emperors. He would go on to make Confucianism the state religion, and create the backbone for the imperial service exam (科举).

**The Han dual religious system:** Though most associate the Han dynasty with Confucianism, and though Han Wudi would make Confucianism the state religion, he would create more of a hybrid legalist-Confucian doctrine. This is shown by his legalist policies and advisors (the whole idea of a centralized government is legalist). Han Wudi even created schools funded by the government to teach the Confucian precepts. This system of a mix of legalist and Confucian ideals would lead to the China we know today and the cultural ideas of the Chinese people (also influencing other Asian nations).

**Taking the south:** While the southern tribes of Minyue (闽越) and Nanyue (南越) fought each other, Han Wudi decided to invade, retaking land lost in the collapse of the Qin dynasty and gaining a lot of nowadays Chinese land. In order to assimilate the southern tribes and keep them from rebelling, Han Wudi used deportation, lowering the concentration of non-Chinese peoples in the south. This and many climate-related issues kept the south of China relatively undeveloped until later dynasties in which the northern nomads invaded, making the Chinese peoples migrate to the south. This flourishing of the south in the Song dynasty led to the peak of the maritime silk road and the prospering of trade in general.

**Zhang Qian (张骞), and the silk road**: A constant thorn in the side of all Chinese dynasties, the northern nomads of the steppes (at this time the Xiongnu (匈奴)) continually raided and demanded tribute from the Han dynasty). As the Han dynasty became stronger, Han Wudi decided to stop the policy of tribute and placation, attacking the nomads in war after war (over a few hundred years, the Han dynasty would finally defeat them, forcing them to migrate to Eastern Europe, becoming the Huns). To do so, Han Wudi needed allies in the west. As a diplomat for the Han dynasty, Zhang Qian was tasked with initiating diplomatic talks between the Han dynasty and the people in Central Asia, helping to build trade routes and forming an alliance with the Yuezhi peoples (who were displaced by the Xiongnu hundreds of years ago), to fight the Xiongnu empire. On his trek to central Asia, Zhang Qian was captured by the Xiongnu, staying in their lands as a prisoner for ten years. Even so, Zhang Qian still remembered his task and escaped when his Xiongnu captors put down their guard. After a long journey, Zhang Qian finally made his way to the sophisticated nations of central Asia. Though he didn’t succeed in creating an alliance with the Yuezhi, he saw the Hellenised city-states of Bactria and Ferghana, and he finally came back to China after 13 years (being captured AGAIN by the Xiongnu on the way back) with valuable information about the Xiongnu and the nations in Central Asia.

**War for the heavenly horses:** After defeating the Xiongnu in a war, Han Wudi would decide to send his armies west, through the Taklamakan desert to attack Ferghana for her heavenly horses. This war is the infamous Greco-Chinese war. More than half the army died from thirst, but after two tries and more than 100,000 Chinese deaths, Han Wudi successfully defeated Ferghana, taking their horses and in the process also taking control of the group of tribes inside of the Tarim basin. Stability from outposts in the Tarim basin would further lead to the creation of the silk road (and you guessed it, the trade of more horses!).

**Issues with war:** In order to gain funds for the war, Han Wudi didn’t want to increase the taxation on the peasantry. Therefore, he had to monopolize the highly profitable iron, minting of coins, and salt industries. Finally, his government would start a trend of selling titles and offices, in order to gain money. This would cause significant problems in the future as only the wealthy, not the talented would get positions. As glorious as some modern games and historians make war seem, war in real life is of course quite gruesome (I know it's obvious, but I think it's worth pointing out). The issue with any ruler who waged continuous war, like Justinian the great of the Byzantine empire, or in this example Han Wudi, is that they use up a nation's resources. So many people died to gain some “heavenly horses”. Therefore, there is a huge disconnect between which rulers were liked by peasants at the time of their rule and nowadays people. Though nowadays we regard Han Wudi’s reign as a golden age in Chinese history, he was not actually very popular with his people, and was seen as outright tyrannical by many.

# Part 5: The downfall of the Western Han dynasty, and the rise of the Xin dynasty

**Introduction:** After the territorial expansion of Han Wudi, and the peak of the Han dynasty under Han Xuandi (汉宣帝), the empire started buckling under growing corruption. Issues start popping up inside of the empire, with certain clans gaining more and more power. This eventually led to the fall of the Western Han dynasty and the rise of the “socialist” Xin dynasty.

**The rise of the Wang clan:** An issue during the Western Han dynasty that caused instability and the decentralization of power, was the growing power of certain consort-clans i.e. the emperor’s maternal relatives (this would become even more problematic later in the Eastern Han dynasty). One example of this was the Lü clan, specifically, empress dowager Lü, who essentially acted as the regent and puppeteer of the Han dynasty’s emperors at the early period of the Han dynasty\*\*\*. If the Lü clan had continued gaining power, they might have overthrown the Han dynasty at its weak and early state. Unfortunately for the Lü clan, empress dowager Lü died, leading to the downfall of the Lü clan (most of empress dowager Lü’s relatives were either killed or removed from the court during the Lü clan disturbance). This type of situation happened frequently as the consort-clans were close to the royal family, meaning they would gain more and more power. Because of young emperors and a childless emperor (which helped these consort clans gain more power as they would be put in the position to influence who would become emperor), the Wang (王) clan became more powerful in the imperial court during the late Western Han dynasty (around the turn of the millennium 0 CE).

**The meteoric rise of Wang Mang (王莽) the humble:** One of the members of the Wang clan was Wang Mang. Unlike his cousins though, because Wang Mang’s father and brother died early on, his family never succeeded in getting high positions in the government (which would have been easier for them due to nepotism in order to fill the court with loyal people). Later in his life, since he was related to the empress, and due to his humble and helpful nature (for example, it’s claimed that when his powerful uncle was sick, he stayed day and night caring for him…), he climbed up the social ladder. Unfortunately, in 5 BCE, he made a mistake by opposing empress dowager Fu, being exiled to Xindu (nowadays Henan). In his exile, Wang Mang kept a low profile (in order to stop accusations of plotting), waiting for the right moment to stage a comeback. An opportunity came in 2 BCE, where because of the death of empress dowager Fu as well as multiple petitions for the return of Wang Mang, emperor Ai (汉哀帝) summoned him back to the capital. In 1 BCE, emperor Ai then died and empress dowager Wang seized power, making Wang Mang the regent.  Wang Mang now with absolute power purged the court of all his enemies. In order to increase his power in preparation to usurp the Han dynasty, Wang Mang continued building his personality cult, with many people submitting “prophecies” in the following years comparing him to other legendary figures. Once we reach 5 CE, the thirteen-year-old emperor became unhappy with Wang Mang, as it was clear to him now that Wang Mang had killed and exiled all his family. In order to stop this threat, Wang Mang poisoned Emperor Ping, installing a one-year-old emperor. After finally defeating all his enemies, Wang Mang took the throne, using the legitimacy due to his cult of personality and the resulting prophecies to become emperor. Usurping and destroying the 200-year-long Western Han dynasty, Wang Mang formed the Xin (新) dynasty in 9 CE. (what a ride, hope you stuck through it!).

**The reign of Wang Mang:** Trying to understand the mess that was Wang Mang is as confusing as trying to understand Caligula. Wang Mang worked so hard over the years to finally defeat the Han dynasty, forming his own dynasty. And then, he just gives it up… He suddenly starts making so many weird decisions like creating “new” coins and renaming cities, trying to take land from the nobility and give it back to the peasantry. Why? It seems that a part of the explanation is that Wang Mang was a fanatical Confucian. One of the beliefs of Confucius is that he believed that the ways of the early Zhou dynasty were the right ones. Therefore, Wang Mang spent all his time as emperor reading book after book about the Zhou dynasty, trying to understand their legal system, and implement it, essentially reversing the times to 1000 years ago. The issue was, there wasn’t a lot of information about the early Zhou dynasty, and a lot of the ideas of that time were outdated, made for a smaller kingdom.

**The meteoric fall of Wang Mang:** Because of all these illogical/strange reforms, everyone turned against Wang Mang. The peasants didn’t like him because the yellow river floods during his reign, causing one of the worst famines in Chinese history. The merchants didn’t like him as he made trading very difficult as the new currencies (yes, there were many) were impractical, many going into the black market simply to use ""normal"" coinage. The nobility/landowners didn’t like him as he was trying to take away all their lands and return to the system in the Zhou dynasty. Once it became clear that everyone hated Wang Mang’s new Xin dynasty, the remnants of the Liu family recruited armies and rebelled.

**Infighting between the rebels, and the rise of Liu Xiu (刘秀):** The two major peasant rebellion movements at the time were the “Red Eyebrows (赤眉)”, from the Shandong (山东) and Jiangxi (江西) regions, and the Green Forests (绿林), led by Liu Xuan (刘玄), from the Henan (河南) and Hubei (湖北) regions. The army of Liu Xuan defeated Wang Mang’s army, retaking the capital and creating the Eastern Han dynasty… Except, that was of course not how the story ended, though since Liu Xuan successfully became emperor, but had to deal with many issues. First of all, he had to handle the opposition of the Liu family, killing Liu Yan (刘演), but sparing his brother Liu Xiu (刘秀), who had before his execution become a prominent general, helping to defeat Wang Mang. Liu Xiu, secretly angry about the death of his brother, started planning a coup. Then, in the year 24 CE, the red eyebrows decided to attack Liu Xuan, destroying his regime. The problem was that though the red eyebrows were good at warfare and had a powerful military, they made many administrative ""mistakes"" (like robbing the people…). Losing the support of the population around the capital and the Guanzhong (关中) region. The red eyebrows ran out of food and supplies. Liu Xiu, who had stayed neutral in the war between Liu Xuan and the red eyebrows saw his opportunity, and defeated the weakened red eyebrows, forming the Eastern Han dynasty, and crowning himself Guangwu Di (光武帝).

# Part 6: The Eastern Han dynasty: Young Emperors, power struggles, and yellow turban rebellions

**Introduction:** With the collapse of the Xin dynasty, a golden age of Chinese history would start, lasting for a whole three emperors before crashing down and burning in the mess of court politics (let's go…).

**The era of prosperity during the Eastern Han dynasty:** After the reign of Guangwu Di from 25 to 57 CE, in which the empire was stabilized and expanded, came the “The rule of Ming and Zhang (明章之治)”. In the reign of these two emperors, the people could finally recuperate (修养身息), with water reserves being built, and farming encouraged. It was at this time that paper was invented, helping the distribution of Chinese texts and making education more accessible and cheaper. Furthermore, there was improvement up to ""perfection"" of many other crafts like that of porcelain creation. Finally, the government was centralized, the Huns were pacified, and Buddhism reached China through the silk road, fighting with Confucianism for the heart of the peoples. This battle of the philosophies/religions would slowly cause the mixing of Buddhism and Confucianism over a millennium to form Neo-Confucianism.

**The slow crumbling of the Liu family's power:** After the first 3 emperors, problems started emerging, as the emperor and his family started losing power to other factions, including the eunuchs, and the nobility/warlords. This was because the child emperors that were puppets of the empress dowagers needed the support of others like the nobility or the eunuchs to retake power from their regents. An example of this is in the reign of Han Huandi (汉桓帝), where things started changing in favor of the eunuchs. This is because in order to regain power from the Liang families clutches, Han Huandi used the help of the eunuchs, heavily rewarding them for helping him. The eunuchs were openly corrupt, and for the first time, with the emperor's approval, as emperor Huan himself was also corrupt, executing anyone who criticized his rule. To illustrate the amount of power the eunuchs had, here is a song lyric describing them: \*""Zuo can reverse heaven's decision. Ju sits by himself without a match. Xu is a lying wolf. Tang's power is as prevalent as the falling rain.”\*According to the Journal of Asian history, this increase in power of people outside the imperial family gradually led to a disregard for imperial authority, shown by the increased amount of forged letters and assassinations in the later Eastern Han dynasty. Indeed, according to the Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient: “private and local power came to replace public authority”. The nobility no longer saw the emperors as ""divine"" and therefore did as they wished, with many increasing their wealth with corruption.

**Administrative issues inside the empire:** In 86 CE, because of the cultural differences between the Han governors and the natives, the sheer size of the empire (making reacting to rebellions slower), and simply bad governors because of corruption, the Qiang peoples of nowadays Xibei (西北)  rebelled. The Qiang peoples and other peoples in southern China would rebel multiple times afterwards and would become a constant nuisance for the Eastern Han dynasty. This on top of the corruption of the eunuchs and emperors who sold titles and dried out all imperial talent, made the situation even direr.

**The yellow turban rebellion:** Finally, because of multiple earthquakes, famines, plagues, and many other natural disasters in China, the people became increasingly desperate. Then, just as everyone was giving up hope, someone named Zhang Jue/Jiao (张角) presented himself as the solution to everyone's problems. He claimed that he could cure people using magical Taoist powers. He also claimed that the Han dynasty had lost the mandate of heaven, and so had to be overthrown. This led to the infamous yellow turban rebellion, which lasted from 184 CE to 205 CE (most of the rebellion was crushed a few years after they revolted, but some remnants survived for quite long). Though the rebellion itself didn’t cause the fall of the Han dynasty, it contributed to the strengthening of the warlords, as the emperor needed their help to defeat the yellow turbans. In the year 189 CE, the emperor suddenly died, and so with the power to do so, He Jin (河津), the brother of the empress dowager and “leader” of the warlord's faction decided to kill all the eunuchs (factionalism was also a factor in the eventual clash between the eunuchs and warlords). To do so, he asked for the help of different warlords around the country and attacked the eunuchs successfully killing them (He Jin died in the fight because of a plot by the eunuchs). Though the warlords won, they were exhausted. And so, when Dong Zhuo (董卓), a tyrant warlord from the far north arrived, he would find the capital in flames, and the two sons of the emperor, killing one and taking the other hostage, making the young emperor his puppet. Thus, the three kingdoms period would begin… (to be continued, and talked about more in detail in a future post).

**End notes:** As will be evident, I’m not an expert on the Han dynasty, I’m just a teenage history nerd who wants to sort out his own understanding of the Han dynasty and start a discussion with people on this fascinating topic. As most of the things in this article I learnt from the internet, my understanding of this time period is quite sporadic and all over the place, so iv'e tried to eliminate that in this article, but some places might still be too detailed and some with not enough detail, so please tell me if there is any hole in my narrative! I hope the notes I took are somehow of value for others, and if there are any mistakes in the post or you have any other feedback, let me know! Have I missed anything important that happened in the Han dynasty? What other part of Chinese history do you find fascinating? What is your opinion of Xiang Yu? Was he a great warrior who valiantly fought off the scoundrel Liu Bang, or was he an arrogant prick who underestimated his enemies?

\* By brothers I don’t mean literal brothers, but ceremonial brothers. At this time period, making someone your “brother” seemed to be the normal way to form a political “alliance” or bond with someone else.

\*\* We have to keep in mind that the most reliable source we have for periods before the Han dynasty are books written in the Han dynasty, like Sima Qian’s “The Records of History (史记)”. The issue with these books is that well… they are written in the Han dynasty, and commissioned by the Han government, so are probably (one hundred percent) biased about the Qin dynasty and the formation of the Han dynasty… Another thing is that troop numbers were commonly bolstered in texts, so they might be inaccurate… Ahhhhhh, what we (amateur) historians love, a scrambled mess of stories/myths, and facts!

\*\*\* Historians don't consider the puppet “emperors” of Empress dowager Lü as legitimate emperors.

Edit: If you have read all the way to the end, it's been a long journey, and I hope this article somehow helped you! I find it fascinating how many people are willing to spend their day reading such a long article and even commenting, and I thank everyone for any feedback that they gave (currently, I don't have time to respond to the comments, and so I will respond in a few hours)!",1658297478.0,2022-07-20 06:11:18+00:00
539,Ctesias and the True Date of the Trojan War,25,w3oygh,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/w3oygh/ctesias_and_the_true_date_of_the_trojan_war/,20,"The Trojan War is normally dated to about 1200 BCE, give or take a few decades, placing it right at the end of the Bronze Age. That date is basically derived from Ancient Greek and Roman statements about when it took place in relation to other events in history. Modern archaeological discoveries relating to Bronze Age Troy are perceived as fitting the legend in some senses, but there is considerable debate about this and many researchers would argue that Homer’s descriptions better fit an Iron Age setting. 

Notably, the calculations of those ancient writers were not necessarily accurate. In fact, in many cases, we know for a fact that their calculations were incorrect. Often this was because of using average generation lengths which were much too high. 

Ctesias’s information about when the Trojan War took place in relation to Assyrian history seems to suffer from this very problem. It seems that he was assuming an average generation length of about 45 years, when a more realistic average would be something like 25 years. For that reason, he massively misdated the Trojan War in relation to the fall of Nineveh. 

Additionally, the fall of Nineveh itself was misdated by almost three centuries by the Greeks, further misdating the Trojan War. 

With the more accurate knowledge we have about things like the fall of Nineveh, we can see where Ctesias’s information *actually* places the Trojan War in the stream of time, and it is much more recent than c. 1200 BCE.

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

541,How did medieval country villages form? Don't farmers (tenant/crofters/serfs) live on their farms? Then whose houses are clumped together to form the village?,74,w392vw,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/w392vw/how_did_medieval_country_villages_form_dont/,78,"So please educate a whole-life urban-dweller, as I've always wondered about this. 

So from how I understand it, medieval (and even earlier) villages are formed by local peasants residing in local communities. If they become large enough, the economy would be able to sustain trades like blacksmiths, etc. Plus churches, etc. 

Good so far?

But here's the thing--from my experience and knowledge, farmers (whether they're landowning gentlemen-farmers or tenant-farmers/sharecroppers) normally live *in* the farm. Among the fields. And given that farms are large plots of land, wouldn't that mean that peasant domiciles are actually very far apart, physically?

I assume I'm missing something and overthinking it? :)

Edit: I am aware that for manors, the village itself may be created and developed directly by the lord, and thus artificially force all their crofters and serfs to live in an centralized area and they'd have to commute outside the village proper to their fields. 

But there are also grassroots villages that just spring up organically. Those are the ones I really wonder about.

Edit 2: I am actually from SE Asia, and am basing my observations on rural farmlands here. Tenant farmers here usually live in small huts located within their farmland itself. And it's a bit of a walk to get to town. So that's why I was wondering how those towns organically came to be in the first place. 

Edit 3: So the consensus is that for the most part, peasant fields weren't that big, and peasants didn't live within the farmland, but instead commuted to work (even if it's just a 10 min walk).

I could find no book dedicated to Suvorov’s campaigns in English, making my only recourse Wikipedia articles, which can hardly be trusted.

But judging from the scant battles he fought recorded on Wikipedia, his victories - of which there were around 60, him never losing a battle - were all either small or indecisive. Focsani was fought between two forces of over 25,000 men each, but casualties were no more than 2,000 for the whole battle. He won great victories against polish rebels, but the articles do not go into great detail on whether these were professional forces or a more slapped together assortment.

The only information that can be found in great depth on his campaigns (from what I’ve seen) is his brief encounter with France in Italy in 1799-1800, where he proved himself capable.

So was he a good commander, on the level of Frederick the Great or Napoleon? Or was he just the only capable European general of the generation between both of them?

However, I've found very few sources regarding the specifics, and I really want to know the specifics.

1. Who counted as a jarl, and how many of them were there? Would an average town house several families of jarls, or was there just one jarl? In the first case, are there different words for the jarl in power and the jarls that answer to him? In the latter case, would every settlement have a jarl ruling it, or were some of them ruled by the karls?
2. Apparently, there was a class called ""bondi"", the wealthy land owners. Who were they, socially speaking? How much power did they have?
3. How many thralls were there in Scandinavia, relatively speaking? Was it common for a family to own a thrall, or did only the rich own them?
4. Apparently, swords were a status symbol. Do we have any idea as to how common they were? Would 1 in 5 professional warriors wield a sword? 1 in 10?
5. Did medieval Scandinavia have taxes and tithes? I've read that rulers bought the loyalty of their followers with lavish gifts. Were they then collecting those riches back through taxes? Who was taxed? Do we know by how much?",1658218971.0,2022-07-19 08:22:51+00:00

Let me also carefully clarify that this does not mean that previous eras were not studied or admired, but specifically the idea that they were patently *better* and that the contemporary world is best served in emulation, and assessed by approximation to the past, not validated on the basis of its own new merits.

For instance, the 1980s in the United States strikes me, for all of the real social problems occurring, to have been notably optimistic and forward-looking in its zeitgeist, represented by not only popular culture but in foreign policy and academia. It's hard to gauge this precisely and separate an unsubstantiated image from an articulated historical reality and to maintain a meaningful and definite status against the inevitable exceptions to any trend, but insofar as I have done this with respect to this example, the impression still remains.

Another strong example would likely be the Europe of the antebellum early 20th century, and the culmination of Victorian notions of progress resulting in a general belief that all disciplines had been effectively learned and that civilization was constantly improving. 

On the contrary, what western historiography had long considered the zenith of its civilization's manifestation in high classical antiquity, is ironically full of an impression that the legendary heroic age was still better: Juvenal decried the decrepit state of Rome's morality, Horace said that his generation was worse than his fathers', who were worse than their own, etc., so some of the most prominent literary examples from the golden age of a culture deemed one of the most penultimate in humanity attest to their own relative paucity of worth against their impression of their own cultural predecessors.

550,What were the fundraising ramifications of the Battle of Monmouth for the American Revolution?,21,vztmfq,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vztmfq/what_were_the_fundraising_ramifications_of_the/,9,"I've been fascinated recently by the Battle of Monmouth - although militarily it was considered a draw, with neither side inflicting much damage or gaining any strategic advantage, the Americans (including Hamilton) played it up as a major victory, and the American press enthusiastically cheered it as a great win.

Indeed, it seems the main purpose of the fight was to generate this ""propaganda victory"". Washington knew that many Americans (including Congress) were getting impatient with his hesitance to assault the British army. He considered that it would look weak to allow them to march unresisted from Philadelphia to New York, and so he engineered a fight just for the sake of facing off the two armies. He didn't seem to truly attempt a strategic coup (like attacking the supply train,) he deliberately chose a smaller engagement that seemed largely designed to risk little while being able to say that we ""beat the British"". And while the claim of victory is not without merit (after all, the Continental Army stood toe-to-toe with the main force of the British Army, fought primarily against their elite units, and ended up taking the field and inflicting more casualties than they took) it seems the real objective was the generation of positive propaganda.

So, my question is, how effective was this propaganda? Did the Battle of Monmouth have a material impact in helping solicit contributions to the rebel cause? At this time, there were still a huge amount of Loyalists in the colonies - did news of Monmouth strike fear into these Loyalists and suppress their activities, and did it encourage those who were ""watching where the wind blows"" to join sides with the rebels? Were people more willing to accept Continental paper currency after hearing of this ""triumph"" of the Americans over the British? Were the states more willing to send money, soldiers, and provisions to Washington's army after this win? It seems that all these factors were the main motivation for the fight - how well did they play out?",1657904500.0,2022-07-15 17:01:40+00:00

By extension this can also include a discussion of the wider context where these archers emerged from, since if we get an idea of Mediterranean archery at the time, as well the religious and cultural beliefs of the Cretans at the time (or rather, over that time period), we can somewhat get an approximate idea of what could have been popular among these archers (both in terms of equipment, fighting style, beliefs, philosophy, etc). 

A specific question could be: were they influenced by Egyptian, Assyrian or Persian archery, and if so, how and to what degree? Being mercenaries, who did they serve? I gather that they were present with Alexander and later also served the Romans.

Do we have any information about views and philosophy, ritual related to their archery, similar to how we have these in other cultures where archery is an important element (see the Turks, Mongols, Japanese, Chinese and others)?",1657866105.0,2022-07-15 06:21:45+00:00

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome.

560,I was recently debating a buddy of mine about what actually makes a bad president and thought Andrew Jackson would be low hanging fruit. I was genuinely surprised when I read about his presidency outside of the trail of tears and winning duels.,181,vw7mg5,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vw7mg5/i_was_recently_debating_a_buddy_of_mine_about/,145," 

I grew up in the fairly conservative educational environment of Zel Miller's Georgia in the 90s. During Georgia History, in the module on Cherokee history, the focus was on Andrew Jackson being an all around bad guy with no redeeming qualities, who was responsible for the trail of tears. Later in US history we were taught about how it was even worse because the Creek and Cherokee tribes helped him defeat the the English in the war of 1812. His success against the English helped him to gain wealth, and later to win the presidency and that him forcing all but a small few who sold out their kin off of the land was a personal betrayal to the very people who had put him in power. 

Going off of these notions I figured it would be easy to find lots of examples of how he was a really bad president, and I was surprised that I'd never heard that:

1. He almost sent the US to war with France because they refused to pay off debts they owed, and they backed down after England begged them not to start another war with the US.
2. He won the election of 1824 against the secretary of state John Quincy Adams, the Speaker of the House Henry Clay, and a Georgian named William Crawford in the popular vote and in the electoral college, but didn't get enough electoral votes to get the Majority. the House of Representatives would have to vote for president with a single vote for each state. Adams won the vote and made Clay his Secretary of State, and Jackson claimed that Clay had approached him and offered to back him and have his supporters back him if he agreed to make him ""Secy"", and when he declined, Clay threw his support behind Adams, winning him the presidency. As a result of this he had a career long goal of abolishing the electoral college and setting up US elections as a popular vote.
3. He believed that Adams had fumbled agreements with the Spanish and given Texas to them despite it being part of the Louisiana Purchase and he wanted Texas badly. He was opposed to violating the US treaty with Mexico and fired his Mexican ambassador for trying to bribe Mexican officials  into giving the land to the US without using the proper channels to get it. He was angry with Sam Houston, who he called a ""former friend"" after the fact, and Stephen Austin for taking Texas by force, and refused to aid them against Mexican soldiers and ships afterward. He was adamant about proving to Santa Anna that the US did not support or recognize the independence of Texas and did not aid them. 
4. After the nation of Texas was more well established, he refused to annex or admit it into the US out of fears that another pro-slave state would cause uproar and possibly lead to a civil war, despite being the orphan of poor Irish immigrants who got rich selling and trading slaves, who was known for being especially brutal to slaves.
5. His primary work while in office was to oppose the Second Bank of the United States which was their equivalent of the federal reserve at the time. He was a populist who claimed the Bank’s charter gave the institution too much power over the nation’s financial markets, he argued—power that enabled it to generate huge profits for its stockholders, most of whom were “foreigners” and “our own opulent citizens.” “If we must have a bank with private stockholders, every consideration of sound policy and every impulse of American feeling admonishes that it should be purely American,” Jackson wrote. Daniel Webster and Henry Clay fought hard to protect the bank and Clay ran in opposition of Jackson for his second term expressly to protect its interests. He wrote that  “It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes,” and that ""This was unjust and dangerous to the humble members of society—the farmers, mechanics and laborers—who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves.” 

After learning all this I am surprised more about him isn't common knowledge, I've never even heard Texans talk about his negative attitude towards their beloved fight for independence.

People like to say that this caused the downfall of Constantinople and that it ""showed who the crusaders really were"" and all that but. Correct me if I'm wrong. But isn't it a terrible idea to invite an army to your country (who are mostly formed from Venetians, economic rivals). Promise them gold for a coup and then get shocked when they act violent and attack you when you don't pay them? 

Yes. Terrible tragedy what happened to the civillians. Not unique for the era and had absolutely nothing to do with religion. I feel like I'm missing something here because the only thing I've gotten from all this was that you don't make debts you can't pay. Hell. The crusaders actually ran into the opposite side when attacking Zara because they were endebted to the Venetians for building a fleet three times their size. A fleet they obviously couldn't pay. They captured Zara to payed their due. Something the Byzantines couldn't or wouldn't do for them.

And yes. It's sad what happened to the city itself. But after the kind of attitude Constantinople was having in the last 3 crusades and after being tired of doing nothing and with the fear of everything being for also for nothing it wouldn't take any hard convincing to do what the crusaders did. To grab as much gold as you can and go home. 

In a few words. If the Byzantines didn't make false promises and didn't make debts they couldn't pay back then the Sack of Constantinople would've never happened. This had absolutely nothing to do with religion and it was no different then any other battle on Western Europe. Hell. How many longer and bigger conflicts have started for smaller reasons?

568,Did British and American support/sympathy for right-wing dictatorships in the 1930s undercut efforts to prevent World War 2?,35,vt398z,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vt398z/did_british_and_american_supportsympathy_for/,33,"So I’ve been doing a lot of reading on the subject of appeasement and would like to hear some perspectives on this.

It's a truism that throughout the 20th and 21st Centuries the United States and Britain supported brutal right-wing dictatorships that committed countless crimes and atrocities. No debate needed there.

However, US support (or rather to me, maybe a confused sympathy) for right-wing fascism in 1930s Europe seems to have a less succinct record that is acknowledged.

Before World War 2, the Britain, France, and the U.S. committed to what I think was a position of malicious neutrality despite Axis aggression in the Spanish Civil War. Their choice to not supply arms to the Republicans to fight Francos' fascists in Spain (while pro-fascist American businesses supplied the Axis powers with oil) helped ensure that Germany and Italy had enough war-making capacity to fight in Central Europe. Roosevelt, to his credit, later admitted he was wrong. Harold Ickes, who was the U.S. Secretary of the Interior at the time, stated that “realistically, neutrality in this instance \[Spanish Civil War\] was lining up with Franco, and lining up with Franco has meant the destruction of Democratic Spain.”

After World War 2, the U.S. incorporated not just Werner Von Braun into the space program, but major Nazi war criminals like [Reinhard Gehlen](https://ips-dc.org/the_cias_worst-kept_secret_newly_declassified_files_confirm_united_states_collaboration_with_nazis/), [Walter Rauff](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-15069333), [Kurt Blome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Blome#Postwar_activities_and_employment_by_the_United_States), Klaus Barbie, and others who were put into places like the CIA or US-backed client-state dictatorships. Their crimes are truly horrendous and unconscionable, they were terrible spies, and it's all in the public record and the government knew about it at the time.

I'd like to quote some revelatory quotes and points from several texts:

""A 1937 Report of the State Department's European Division described the rise of Fascism as the natural reaction of ""the rich and middle classes, in self-defense"" when the ""dissatisfied masses, with the example of the Russian revolution before them, swing to the Left."" Fascism therefore ""must succeed or the masses, this time reinforced by the disillusioned middle classes, will again turn to the Left."" The Report also noted that ""if Fascism cannot succeed by persuasion \[in Germany\], it must succeed by force."" (“State Department, 16 February 1937, “Memorandum for the Honorable Norman H. Davis: A Contribution to a Peace Settlement,” Box 24, Davis Papers.” (If anyone has a link where the report could be read in full, I'd love to get that!)

""The U.S. Ambassador to Russia William Bullitt ""believed that only Nazi Germany could stay the advance of Soviet Bolshevism in Europe."" (Daniel Yergin, Shattered Peace; p. 26) Harold Ickes, on the other hand, said ""the wealthy class of England is so afraid of Communism, which has constituted no threat at all in England, that they have thrown themselves into the arms of Nazism, and now they don’t know which way to turn.” Hitler apparently said to G. W. Ludeckel: ""I’ve got to play ball with capitalism and keep the Versailles powers in line by holding aloft the bogey of Bolshevism–make them believe that a Nazi Germany is the last bulwark against the Red Flood."" (I Knew Hitler; p. 422)

Within the Chamberlain government, Under-Secretary Vansittart ""thought that Hitler was exploiting fears of a ""Bolshevist menace"" as a cover for ""expansion in Central and South-Eastern Europe,"" and one might argue that the views of Neville Chamberlain, Lord Halifax, and especially Neville Henderson might confirm that, even when people like Churchill and Vansittart seemed to know better.

In the British Press, William Shirer made note that Norman Ebutt "" complained to me in private that The Times \[a major British newspaper\] does not print all he sends, that it does not want to hear too much of the dark side of Nazi Germany and apparently has been captured by the pro-Nazis in London. He is discouraged and talks of quitting.”

Some further points:

Why is the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 never discussed? The agreement set no limits on ground forces and allowed the German Navy to be up to 35% of Britain's capacity. Is this not important at all? Is there more context to this? ""For it was obvious to the most simple mind in Berlin that by agreeing to Germany’s building a navy a third as large as the British, the London government was giving Hitler free rein to build up a navy as fast as was physically possible—one that would tax the capacity of his shipyards and steel mills for at least ten years. It was thus not a limitation on German rearmament but an encouragement to expand it, in the naval arm, as rapidly as Germany could find the means to do so.” (William Shirer, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich) How about the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty that seemed borne out of at least a bare recognition by France and the Soviet Union that Nazi Germany posed a threat to Central Europe at that time? It seems notable to me that given this agreement, neither the Soviet Union nor Czechoslovakia were even invited to the Munich Conference where the matter of the Sudetenland, and the obvious implications for civil rights therein, was in question.

I just have so many questions, but this aspect of the interwar period seems to never be fully entertained. It seems to me to be one of the most important lessons to learn in full. Was the U.S., Britain, and France complicit in the buildup to World War 2 to a degree greater than is acknowledged?",1657148530.0,2022-07-06 23:02:10+00:00

You'd think that medieval Europe has been done to death, that other areas need to get their time to shine as well etc., and that's correct.

However, I also feel that the ""classic"" depiction of what ""Medieval Europe"" is, is also so narrow and lacking, that even when you focus on central Europe, there's still so much to discover.

An example from my own childhood:

Due to the common depiction of medieval castles in media, which focuses mainly on castles made of grey stone slabs, I thought there were absolutely no castles where I grew up.

Later, I realized that that notion was quite stupid; while the area I grew up in isn't really all that important historically speaking, of course the counts and dukes built castles here. However, they didn't adhere to the typical depiction seen in media, but were instead built in a style called [brick gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Gothic).

That style is seldomly depicted in media, the only instances I know of are the Teutonic Campaign of Medieval 2: Total War, depicting the Teutonic Crusades in the baltics, and factions like the Burgundians in Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition.

IMHO, it's a shame, since I simply love the style and would love to see it more often in movies or even as a Lego version or something.

572,Bookclub Wednesday!,34,vsna82,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vsna82/bookclub_wednesday/,69," Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, [r/history](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/) also has a recommended list of things to \[read, listen to or watch\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist))",1657105213.0,2022-07-06 11:00:13+00:00

Trench warfare had already begun, and were already showing signs of not changing throughout the war. Conditions in the trenches were horrible and I have no doubt that the high command were aware of all these. 

Also, I'm aware that at least the British were surmising that the war was going to be long. 

Valentine Fleming, then MP of British Parliament, said-  

""It's going to be a long war, in spite of the fact that on both sides every man wants it stopped right now.""

I am inclined to believe that the German politicians and military leaders also echoed these same thoughts, at least privately, if not publicly. 

So, my question then is, why did the war in the Western Front at least not end by 1915 with a peace agreement between both sides?",1657082275.0,2022-07-06 04:37:55+00:00

It is well known that the lookouts that night did not have binoculars, but they really wouldn't have helped. In fact, they would have narrowed the lookouts' vision and made the iceberg even harder to see. Furthermore, there was an atmospheric phenomenon that raised the horizon that night called a cold-weather mirage, and it made it so the iceberg couldn't be seen until they were almost on top of it. Add that to just how dark it was at 11:30-40. How helpful would they have been
2. I know this is weird to say, but extra lifeboats probably would not have saved as many lives as you might think. The lifeboats started to be lowered at 12:40-ish. By the time that the last two lifeboats (Collapsibles A and B, located next to the first funnel) were being prepared (2:05-2:15), the bridge was already flooding. The ship would last only 5 minutes more. They only had enough time for the 20, and even then, those two boats had to be floated off the ship in bad condition. Collapsible A was completely swamped , due to there not being enough time to raise the canvas sides, and Collapsible B got flipped upside down. Sure, some extra lifeboats could have been floated off, but due to the violent nature of the ship's last moments, how many lives could they have saved? Boat A had 13 people in it that survived the night (because everyone else in there had frozen to death), and Boat B had 29 men on top of it.

\*Edit\* Yes, I fully understand that many of the lifeboats were launched half full, many even worse than that. I also understand that many of the lifeboats were lowered at around the same time. Yet even if all of the original lifeboats were loaded to capacity, that still would have been about 1,178 people out of 2,208. Even if more lifeboats were being loaded and launched, by the time Collapsibles A and B floated off, probably only 100-ish people would have been able to get off the ship in good condition. 

3.  There is no evidence that Bruce Ismay, chairman of White Star Line, goaded Captain Smith into running at full speed. He had a corporate mind, yes, but was not mindlessly reckless. It's possible his presence had an influence, but that is just speculation. Even then, the speed of the ship was normal. Second Officer Lightoller said in his British Inquiry testimony that it was common practice that a ship speed through an ice field to get through it as fast as possible. There were no ""villains"" in the Titanic story. No one was mindlessly reckless, nor had malicious intent, nor completely careless. Everyone was just trying to do their best. It was simply bad luck that the iceberg was struck, and struck in a way that highlighted the flaws the ship had.",1656993501.0,2022-07-05 03:58:21+00:00

The situation in 1529 was much more dire, Constantinople had already fallen, the east Mediterranean, Balkans and Hungary gradually followed suit and a 100 000-strong hostile force had besieged Vienna. Even worse the Ottoman Empire was known to be planning to use the area as a staging point for a combined army of over 300 000 warriors and janissaries, raised with the express purpose of overrunning the rest of the European nations and bringing the entire continent under its control, forces that the defending Holy Roman Empire was coming under increasing financial strain to match.

581,Ammianus Marcellinus on magic and paganism in the Roman empire of the 4th century CE. Few instances & an attempt of cross-checking,301,vplzem,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vplzem/ammianus_marcellinus_on_magic_and_paganism_in_the/,9,"Actually a short collection of excerpts, written by Ammianus Marcellinus in his Res Gestae of the 4th century CE, that are giving a view of magic & pagan practices and their treatment of his time by the Roman authorities; along with some really basic notes/analysis. Surely not an exhaustive list, rather few excerpts containing indicative & interesting instances, that I've read lately.

Besides of course my pure interest on the narrated facts, some thoughts occurred regarding **reliability**, too. Cause, as I've understood, Marcellinus being a pagan, hasn't always been considered totally objective by some scholars; especially regarding christianity.

However I'm not sure if this would reach to the point of inventing stories, or it was just an implied stance. Barnes \[2008, p. 2\], though has suggested Marcellinus' bias and sometimes lack of objectivity, he's writing: ""*It is by far our fullest, most precise and most reliable narrative source for military campaigns and political events at the imperial court in the fourth century*"".

In any case, the excerpts were quite interesting.

>\* *Free renderings & translations of the latin & greek texts are mine. A translation of Marcellinus' history by John C. Rolfe of 1935, is given for each entry via perseus site, but with no different meanings; just for ease of access. Armenian texts are given via english or french translations.*

**1. Sorcery & paganism are really close according to Marcellinus**

[**Res Gestae 21.2.4**](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:21.2.4)

>Marcellinus, narrating events of 360 CE, before Julian the apostate became emperor, is mentioning that Julian was still hiding his pagan identity, sharing it only with few. So he was practicing with them soothsaying/divination \[haruspicina\] and augury \[augurium\], and all that the worshippers of gods always do \[deorum semper fecere cultores\]

It's obvious that Marcellinus thinks that the art of divination was usually practiced by pagans /worshippers of \[many\] gods.

**2. Persecution of magic/paganism since Constantius II**

[**Res Gestae 16.8.2**](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:16.8.2)

>Marcellinus speaking generally for the year 358 CE, says that was condemned to death \[poenaliter interibat\] anyone who consulted an expert \[peritus\], i.e. soothsayer, about the sounds of a shrew-mouse \[occentu soricis\] or the crossing with a weasel \[occursu mustelae\], or anything similar, and even when one would search help to the incantations of an old woman \[anile incantamentum\] for the relief of pains.

[**Res Gestae 19.12.14**](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:19.12.14)

>Some chapters ahead for the year 359 CE, Marcellinus writes that was condemned to death, also, anyone who would wear an amulet for quartan ague or for pains, or anyone who would pass by a grave \[monumentum\] in the evening, as a poisoner/sorcerer \[veneficus\], and collector of the horrors of tombs and of the vain sports of the wandering there ghosts.

Harsh penalty for such 'crimes'.

Though there's a thought that poisoning was criminalized more generally since the homicide law 'Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficiis' \[80 BCE ca\], it seems that there's none surviving clear legislation on magic, till the years of christianity in the Roman empire \[check eg. Dickie, 2003, p. 242ff\]. Just to have a clue, the main laws against magic and paganism have been issued since 319 CE \[Constantine I the Great\], usually in the form of decrees addressing to Prefects, and have been incorporated in the so-called Theodosian Code; chapters 9.16 De maleficis & 16.10 De paganis respectively \[original latin text in [thelatinlibrary](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/theodosius.html) & suggested translation by [Pharr, 1952](https://archive.org/details/theodosiancodeno0000unse_t2u1)\].

I'm giving here some notable highlights till the years of Valens.

* 319 CE \[Constantine I the Great\]: it's forbidden the visit of a soothsayer \[haruspex\] in one's home. The soothsayer will be burned \[concremando\], and the one who called him will be exiled in an island \[in insulam detrudendo\]. While they are encouraged the public ceremonies, even to altars, to serve one's superstitions \[CTh.9.16.1 & 2\].
* 321 CE \[Constantine I the Great\]: in the same spirit they were forbidden the domestic pagan sacrifices \[sacrificiis domesticis\] \[CTh.16.10.1pr.\].
* 341 CE \[Constantius II\]: prohibition of superstitions and sacrifices in general, with vengeance and sentence \[CTh.16.10.2\]
* 346 CE \[Constantius II\]: protection for the pagan temples outside the walls of the city, only as buildings \[intactae incorruptaeque\] \[CTh.16.10.3\]
* 346 CE \[Constantius II\]: closing of pagan temples and prohibition of approach under the penalty of death by an avenging sword \[gladio ultore\] \[CTh.16.10.4\]
* 353 CE \[Constantius II\]: prohibition of noctural sacrifices, that ursuper Magnetius had permitted \[sacrificia nocturna\] \[CTh.16.10.5\]
* 357 CE \[Constantius II\] to the people: capital punishment with an avenging sword \[gladio ultore\] for soothsayers \[haruspex\], astrologers \[mathematicus\], wizards \[magus\], sorcerers \[maleficus\] fortunetellers \[hariolus\], and all who ask counsel from them \[CTh.9.16.4\]
* 357 CE \[Constantius II\]: repetition of the sacrifice prohibition in general, under the penalty of death, but also of the worship of images \[=colere simulacra\] \[CTh.16.10.6\]
* 358 CE \[Constantius II\]: will not escape the punishment and torture \[tormentum\], those who have rank \[dignitas\] if they would be soothsayers \[haruspex\], astrologers \[mathematicus\], wizards \[magus\], sorcerers \[maleficus\] fortunetellers \[hariolus\], augurs \[augur\], and the practicers of every art of divination \[ars divinandi\]. It's noticeable that it's written 'tormentum' \[torture\] & 'cruciatus' \[torture/crucifying\] \[CTh.9.16.6\]
* 364 CE \[Valentinian and Valens\]: suitable punishment for nefarious prayers, magical preparations and funeral sacrifices, during night-time \[CTh.9.16.7\]
* 370 CE \[Valentinian and Valens\]: capital punishment for astrology teaching \[CTh.9.16.8\]
* 371 CE \[Valentinian, Valens and Gratian\]: explicit exception of soothsaying \[haruspicina\] from any relation with sorcerers \[maleficus\] and superstition \[religio\]; thus no crime \[CTh.9.16.9\]

According to these, the previous Marcellinus' narratives seem just an enforcement of law.

**3. Athanasius bishop of Alexandria and Constantius II in 357; suspicions of sorcery**

[Res Gestae 15.7.8](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:15.7.8)

>On events of 356 CE ca, Marcellinus is writing few paragraphs around Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria. He's talking about a church council \[synodus\] that removed Athanasius from his position, cause ""he tried to learn external \[things\]"" \[scitarique conatum externa\]; as rumors \[rumores\] were saying. Then, he's adding \[again as a saying: dicebatur\], that Athanasius could predict future, being skilled in the prophetic lots \[fatidicarum sortium\] and in the prophecies indicated by the birds \[augurales portenderent alites\].

Taking in account the context, this synod should be the one in Milan of 355. Athanasius, an orthodox bishop of Alexandria, is known for his fight against Arianism, which included synods, accusations, removals, exiles. And emperor Constantius II was most possibly a semi-Arian \[see various spots in  Berndt & Steinacher 2014\]. Marcellinus obviously chooses not to devote many words on Athanasius in his surviving work.

And searching for some cross-checking, I saw that, though in Athanasius' works there're many implications of false-accusations, clear corresponding information can be seen in Sozomen's church history of the 5th c. CE \[indicated by Vakaloudi, 2000, p. 343ff\].

Already since Synod of Tyre in 335 CE \[under Constantine I the Great\], Athanasius was accused for sorcery \[γοητεία\]; so says Sozomen \[[ChHist 2.25, PG 64, 1004-5](https://books.google.gr/books?id=WivbHxo0L-sC&pg=PA1005#v=onepage&q&f=false) & [eng.wiki](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II/Volume_II/Sozomen/Book_II/Chapter_25)\] but also Theodoret of the 5th c. CE \[[ChHist 1.28, PG 82, 988](https://books.google.gr/books?id=SoHiFUO9LLYC&pg=PA987#v=onepage&q&f=false) & [eng.wiki](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II/Volume_III/Theodoret/Ecclesiastical_History/Book_I/Chapter_28)\]. At another instance Sozomen writes \[[ChHist 2.23, PG 67, 992-3](https://books.google.gr/books?id=WivbHxo0L-sC&pg=PA993#v=onepage&q&f=false) & [eng.wiki](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II/Volume_II/Sozomen/Book_II/Chapter_23)\] that Athanasius was falsely accused by the christian sect of Melitians for killing a priest called Arsenius and keeping his arm for sorcery \[γοητεία\]. Sozomen \[[ChHist 4.10, PG 67, 1133](https://books.google.gr/books?id=WivbHxo0L-sC&pg=PA1133#v=onepage&q&f=false) & [eng.wiki](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_II/Volume_II/Sozomen/Book_IV/Chapter_10)\] is also narrating how Athanasius was informed by god \[θεόθεν\] about a persecution and escaped. According to him, this and other similar incidents resulted to being slandered for sorcery \[γοητεία\] by opposing Greeks \[i.e. pagans\] and heterodox. And a picturesque incident occurred when Athanasius, walking in Alexandria, was asked to explain to the crowd what a crow was saying.

So at least it seems that Marcellinus' narrative is based somehow on truly said rumors; as they are reproduced by christian historians a little later.

**4. Patricius and Hilarius, two tortured pagans**

[Res Gestae 29.1.33](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:29.1.33)

>In the start of the 29th book, on events of 371 CE, Marcellinus is describing how it was investigated and revealed a said 'plot' against emperor Valens. The Roman authorities in Antioch, starting with some irrelevant accusations, reached to a certain ex-governor Fidustius \[praesidalis\]. Fidustius confessed that with the help of the secret arts of Hilarius and Patricius, it was revealed to them the name of the future-successor of emperor Valens, namely Theodorus; Marcellinus adds that Fidustius was 'already tortured to death' \[excarnificatus iam ad interitum\].  
>  
>Marcellinus then is trying to justify Valens for his cruel reactions and precautions, calling him 'somehow foolish' \[surrusticus\] and describing recent plots against him that probably would have an effect at his judgement. He then adds that some details might have escaped from his memory but he would give a free summary of what he can remember \[quae recolere possumus\], giving the quick impression of being an eyewitness.  
>  
>Hilarius and Patricius were brought in front of the judges and described with some details their magic activities; their method was including a tripod, a hanging ring and letters, like a fortunetelling pendulum. And when they were asked, probaby ironically, if they had foreseen their sufferings, they answered with some greek lyrics that would underline their no-repentance. Marcellinus gave some that included a revenging for their blood Tissiphone and Ares. After these heard, they, being tortured with hooks, were taken away 'lifeless' \[exanimes\].

The term 'exanimes' has been interpreted as 'unconscious' rather than 'dead' \[check eg. den Boeft et al., 2013, p. 56\]. However I'm a little sceptical on this. The same incident, is given by the later pagan historian Zosimus of the 5th c CE \[[New History 4.14-15](https://books.google.gr/books?id=qN8TAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA170#v=onepage&q&f=false) & [eng.livius](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/zosimus/zosimus-new-history-4/zosimus-new-history-4.15/)\], where they are mentioned among others Hilarius of Phryia and Patricius of Lydia, philosophers, who were killed by the Romans under the possible charges of sorcery and conspiracy. In the general Zosimus' description of 'killing', the famous at the time philosopher Maximus of Ephesus was among the victims. On this Marcellinus agrees \[[29.1.42](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:29.1.42)\]; Maximus was beheaded \[capite truncatus\]. In any case I don't think that Hilarius and Patricius were spared in the end.

Zosimus is describing them as 'condemned by envy, rather than by fair vote', while Marcellinus is speaking about tortures. Forced confession?

Another notable observation seems to be made by Malingrey, but I didn't have direct access, only citations: Marcellinus \[[29.1.44](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:29.1.44)\] is mentioning some who managed to save their lives in the aforementioned mass persecution, that was committed by Valens. There's a recorded by scholars connection with a passage in St John Chrysostom's 3rd Homily 'De incomprehensibili dei natura' \[38\]. Chrysostom speaking in front of an audience of Antioch in 386 CE ca, he reminds them an incident \[10 years before the speed\] where the crowd of the city saved a man from ""the royal wrath"" in the hippodrome, at a time when plots against the king had occurred. It's noteworthy that Chrysostom is mentioning that the rescued ""was worthy of no pardon"" \[check Harkins, 1984, p. 112 & den Boeft et al., 2013, p. 72\].

In any case it seems here that fortune-telling was a means of the main accusation, that was conspiracy against emperor. However, mass persecution followed by Valens.

**5. The wizard Armenian king Pap(a)**

[Res Gestae 30.1.17](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:stoa0023.stoa001.perseus-eng1:30.1.17)

>In 373 CE ca, Roman emperor Valens tried to imprison Pap(a), king of Armenia, probably for control; who in the end was murdered one year later. In any case, Valens at the time had sent two of his officers for this capture attempt, Danielus and Barzimeres, who after their failure, excused themselves by claiming that king Pap was a wizard. Specifically by: ""pretending that he \[=Pap\] had expertise, through enchantments of Circe, in transforming and debilitating \[human\] bodies in marvelous ways"". Claims that increased Valens' hatred to Pap.

The first two things I thought was firstly that Homeric sorceress Circe hadn't been forgotten and then that 'magic' was used easily for accusations in the 4th c. CE.

But then Barnes \[2008, p. 81\] indicated that Marcellinus mentions nothing about Armenian archbishop Nerses, whom king Pap poisoned and killed; according to the 5th c. Armenian historian P'avstos Buzand \[[5.21-24](http://www.attalus.org/armenian/pb8.htm#24).\]. Lenski \[2014, p. 177\] calls Nerses ""*close Roman contact*"", using mainly church sources; probably underlining the importance of the incident. In fact Marcellinus is referring mostly to a plot by Valens' officer Terentius, as a cause of the hostile emperor's attitude towards Pap. But Marcellinus uses the verb 'novimus' \['we have learned'\], indicating maybe some subjectivity. Additionally Nerses seems to be praised for his virtues by P'avstos Buzand of the 5th c., probably as a non-Arian but a christian of the Nicene Creed. Emperor Valens, however, was most possibly a semi-Arian, homoian \[see various spots in Berndt & Steinacher 2014\]. While Armenian king Pap seems to be an Arian, of an Arian king dynasty, according to all works I've read.

Garsoian \[1989, p. 10\], commenting in general the Armenian history of P'avstos Buzand wrote of some relevant ignorance of facts, inaccuracies and anachronisms. The incident of the poisoning of Nerses by Pap(a) is described by two more Armenian sources of the time; Vita Nerses \[12-14\] & History by Movses Khorenatsi \[3.38\]. In all three works I've tracked at least one common anachronism or confusion at one other instance; all three are saying that Valens died before Nerses wrongly \[P'avstos 4.13, V.Nerses 8, Khorenatsi 3.33\].

Lenski \[2014, p. 179\] notices also that in the Armenian texts about Nerses, king Pap appears as possessed by demons \[dews, devs\]; using the argument actually as cross-checking with Marcellinus' narrative about sorcery.

http://costumedabbler.ca/cotton

http://evashistoricalcostumes.blogspot.com/p/article-cotton-in-the.html?m=1

Italy had a cotton industry very early on and grew it locally, too  (like in Sicily). Later on, it would become an industry in Southern Germany.

Cotton was apparently cheap and used for curtains, table cloths, sails and undergarments. A lot of it was also simply mixed with other fibers.

There's some disdain for cotton in the reenactment and Larping scene because it is considered inauthentic. That might be the case for certain time periods and regions but not as a general statement IF those two blog posts are reliable.

I am wondering what your opinion on the two blog posts is and whether it is reasonable for a Medievil-ish reenactor/larper to utilize cotton under certain circumstances. Is cotton even available in a somewhat hostorically accurate weave?",1656699093.0,2022-07-01 18:11:33+00:00

585,History of ancient city of Aigai in Aiolis,164,voa59u,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/voa59u/history_of_ancient_city_of_aigai_in_aiolis/,7,"   

Aigai, located in the province of Manisa, was established on the Gün Mountain in the Yunt Mountain Range, which was named Aspordene in ancient times. Today, Yunt Mountain is administratively located within the provincial borders of Manisa and İzmir. Its total area is 3,521,70 km wide, and it is bordered by the Bakırçay (ancient Kaikos) in the north, the Gediz (ancient Hermos) river in the south, Kırkağaç and Akhisar plains in the east and the Çandarlı Bay in the west. Highest peak of Yunt mountains, which consists of 500m-1000m hills and plains between them, stands at 1076 m. In ancient times, the mountain was the border between Mysia and Aiolis. The most important ancient settlement on the Yunt Mountain was Aigai. The archaeological data and border stones show that Aigai controlled most of the Yunt Mountain, especially in the Hellenistic Period. W.M. Ramsay suggests in his publication in 1890 that Aigai’s borders were covering a large area. 

Aiolis region, which includes an important part of the Yunt Mountain, is on the Western Anatolian shores and roughly covers the area between Gediz (Hermos) valley and Bakırçay (Kaystros) and Lesbos Island. Aeolians living in the Aiolis region and speaking a dialect of Ancient Greek, came from the north of Greece and settled in the region. 

According to tradition, these immigrants coming from Boiotia and Thesselia regions to Anatolia settled in the Western Anatolian shores in the second half of 11th century BCE. Pseudo-Herodotus, the famous historian who lived in the first age, in his work ""The Life of Homer"", quotes that the migration of Aeolians to the northwestern Anatolian shores started with the invasion of Lesbos Island in 1140 BCE. According to him, Cyme was founded in 1120; Neonteichos in 1112; and Smyrna in 1102. The Byzantine historian Eusebius, on the other hand, only dates the foundation of Myrina among these cities, to 1047 BCE about a century later. 

First group of immigrants most likely have settled along the shore. Aigai, which is 13 km inland, must have been founded later. This can be explained by the first migrants initially taking control of the area on the shore, then colonizing the hinterlands due to the population growth. Archaeological excavations and research conducted at Aigai since 2004, show that the city was founded around 700 BCE. 

Ancient geographer Strabo quotes that “Cyme is the best and largest of Aeolis cities. It can be said that Cyme and Lesbos are the metropolis (founder city) of other cities, of which up to thirty and many of which were destroyed. As can be understood from this statement, some of other Aeolian cities such as Aigai, must have been established by Cyme later. Hellenistic immigration, which had started with insufficient population to utilize hinterlands of Aiolis region as farmlands or pastures, made it necessary to expand into the hinterlands with the increase in population. 

Also, Aeolian cities which are located on the coast and are economically developed, had to keep the hinterland under control for their protection. An important ancient route passing through the slopes of Aigai, which is located on one of the important valleys lays between Lydian land and the northwestern shores of Anatolia, was connecting Magnesia (Manisa) to Elaia, the ancient port of Pergamon, and Gryneion (Yeni Şakran). These routes clarify why the Aigaians chose the area. With the foundation of the ancient city of Aigai, Yunt Mountain region must have been controlled by the Aeolians beginning from the late 8th century BCE. 

The name “Aigai” is rarely encountered in ancient written sources. However, historical events that took place in the region must have directly affected the ancient city. Midas, the last king of the Phrygians, gained the trust of Greek rulers by getting married with Hermodike the daughter of the king of Kyme, the most powerful city of the Aiolis region. This marriage has been accepted as proof of direct or indirect relationship between the Phrygians and the Aeolians on the northwestern Anatolian coast in the first half of 7th century BCE. Lydians who saved Anatolia from the Kimmer threat was the most important power of the region since the 7th century BCE. The Lydian effect on Archaic pottery found at Aigai and imported Lydian pottery prove that the region was highly influenced by the Lydian culture in 7th and 6th centuries BCE. By 546-547, the western Anatolia began to be dominated by Persians. Xenophon, in his work Hellenika, mentions that Aigai and Temnos had resisted the Persian rule and maintained their independence (Xenophon, Hell. IV.8.5). Also, according to the text, Spartan commander Derkyllidas says that Aigai and Temnos had been independent since the beginning of Persian rule in order to convince his soldiers to march on the Persians at Aiolis. Their independence may have been caused due to the fact that the cities’ location in a mountainous area and lack of Persians’ attention to the two cities. 

According to Plutarch (Them, 26.1-4), the famous Athenian statesman Themistocles, turned his way to the city of Aigai, while fleeing from Greece towards Kyme in 471/70 BCE, and without being seen, he was welcomed and hosted by his close friend Nikogenes. Then, he disguised as a woman, and continued on his way to Susa in a tent car. This proves the existence of wealthy and aristocratic families in and around Aigai from at least the 5th century BCE. Aigai was among the cities that did not pay tax to the Attica-Delos Sea League, which was established in the 5th century BCE against the Persian threat. Written sources dated to the 4th century BCE do not mention Aigai.

After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, his successors, the Diadochi fought for control over the empire’s land. Lysimachos lost his life after he was defeated at the Battle of Couroupedium against Seleucus, in 281 BCE. After the Battle of Couroupedium, in an environment of turmoil arising from the murder of Seleucus I, many cities gained their independence. A decree found in the Aigai excavations provides important information on this period. According to the decree, the Seleucid kings Seleucıs I Nicator and his son Antiochus I Soter were honored with divine attributes in the city. Also, this inscription, erected after the victory at the Battle of Couroupedium (281 BC), mentions the deeds Seleucus I and Antiochus accomplished for the city and the day Aigai gained its freedom.

Pergamon Kingdom put an end to the good relations they maintained with the Seleucids during the Eumenes I Period (263-241 BCE) and extended their boundaries to the north, east and southwest. During this period, control of Aigai must have passed to Pergamon Kingdom. During the Period of Attalus I, the defeat of Galatians (238/237 BCE) and then the Seleucid king Antiochus Hierax (229-227 BCE), the Kingdom of Pergamon has become the most important power of the Western Anatolia. The important achievements of Attalus I did not last long. After the Seleucid attacks under the command of General Achaeus (223 BCE), Attalus I had lost Aigai and shores of the Aiolis. After the murder of Achaeus, who rebelled against Antiochus II (216 BCE), Pergamon Kingdom took control of Aigai and its surroundings again.

The Aiolis region and Aigai must have lived under the rule of Attalus Dynasty (Attalus I) between 218 and197 BCE. By the reestablishment of Seleucid control in the western Anatolia by Antiochus III in 197 BCE, the control of Aigai must have passed to Seleucids. Seleucids was forced to retreat to the south of the Taurus Mountains and leave the region by the Apamea Peace Treaty signed in 188 BCE. Aigai was also mentioned among the cities that gained their freedom after the Apamea Treaty. It is understood that Aigai and the whole Aiolis region has gained its independence.

According to Polybius (His. XXXIII.13), Aigai was damaged during the war between Attalus II and Prusias II, king of Bithynia, in 156-154 BCE. In 154 BCE, Prusias II paid 100 talents as compensation to the cities damaged. Monumental public buildings such as Bouleuterion, Agora Building, Theater and Gymnasion were built at exactly this period, just after the middle of the 2nd century BCE. Attalus III donated his kingdom to Rome with a rational political decision, before his death in 133 BCE. After this date, Aigai and the surrounding region continued to exist under the rule of Rome. The earliest evidence of Roman rule in Aigai is from the 1st century BCE.

Proconsul Publius Servilius Isauricus, a reliable man and close friend of Ceasar, helped the city and made donations for the Temple of Apollo Chresterios during his tenure as Governor of Asia (46-44 BCE). A dedicatory inscription on a sculpture base from Aigai shows that Publius Servilius Isauricus was honored in Aigai for his help. Similarly, Publius Servilius Isauricus reestablished traditional laws and independent democracy in Pergamon, and because of this, he gained the title of ""savior and benefactor of the city"".

According to ancient writers, one of the biggest earthquakes in Anatolian history, occurred in 17 CE. Roman historian Tacitus provides detailed information about this earthquake and gives the names of the most affected cities as Sardis (Salihli) and Magnesia (Manisa). Tacitus said, “...in the same year, the twelve important cities of Asia were destroyed at midnight by an earthquake."" Roman emperor Tiberius was not very willing to help the states. However, he had made donations to Aigai and other eleven Western Anatolian cities for the destruction caused by the earthquake. A monument to honor the emperor in response to the help he had done was erected in Puteoli by the twelve Anatolian cities. There is no doubt that Yunt Mountain and other cities in the Aiolis region were also affected by the earthquake of 17 CE.

The Goths, a nomadic tribe, destroyed and sacked many cities in the second half of the 3rd century CE.  The traces of Goths threat that appeared around 260 CE, are possible to see in Aigai. The blockage by walls of the doors of the buildings dated to the 3rd century CE, show the Aigaians were aware of the approaching Goths threat. Archaeological data obtained from the excavations prove that the city was deliberately abandoned by settlers. Coins hidden in a cistern and dated to the 3rd century CE suggest that the settlers were planning to return the city. It is not known where Aigains and other settlers who lived on the Yunt Mountain area were fled at the time of the Goth danger. However, it is clear that they could not return to their cities.

After being abandoned in the 3rd century CE, Aigai was settled again after nearly a thousand years. The last period of settlement in the city dated to the late 12th century CE. Evidence of the late Byzantine castle-settlement dated to this period is limited to the Eastern Church area. Remains of Byzantine buildings and tombs were unearthed around the church which had served a small Christian community. After the 1280s, the small Byzantine settlement at Aigai must have had its share from the Turkmen attacks took over the lands of Western Anatolia. A date around 1300 at the latest is thought of for the settlement of Turkmen groups in the area.",1656600427.0,2022-06-30 14:47:07+00:00

593,The Rise and Fall of China's First Empire: The Qin (秦) Dynasty,1224,vjhwc9,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vjhwc9/the_rise_and_fall_of_chinas_first_empire_the_qin/,96,"**Introduction:** The *Qin (秦) dynasty* is the shortest official Chinese dynasty, lasting only from 221 to 206 BCE. In China, this dynasty is known for its oppressive rule and the building of the first version of the Great Wall of China (yes, there are multiple versions).

**The rise to dominance of the state of** ***Qin:*** For a long time, the state of *Qin* was the weakest\* state of the Warring States period. To understand the rise to dominance of this vassal state, we have to go back all the way to the year 905 BCE. At this time period, because of his ability to raise horses, a man named *Qin Feizi* gained the favor of the current *Zhou* king. With the rapid expansion of the *Zhou* dynasty because of the system of feoffment\*\*, *Qin Feizi* was granted the land of *Qin*, and he became the first feudal lord of the *Qin* state (imagine becoming the leader of a small country because you’re good at taming horses…). Hundred years passed with little to no change (this is obviously simplified), until a philosopher and politician named *Shang Yang* (商鞅), a frustrated official in *Wei (卫国)*, came to the state of *Qin*. At the time, duke *Xiao* of the *Qin* state was seeking for talented people, and *Shang Yang* was that talent. After some deliberation, the duke of *Qin* decided that being one of the weakest states of the Warring States period, he had no chance to win and unify China without radical reforms, so in 356 BCE, he appointed *Shang Yang* to reform his state.

**What in the world is Legalism?** To really understand the reforms of *Shang Yang*, (and those of the *Qin* dynasty in general) it’s useful to understand the philosophy that was behind his and most of the *Qin* dynasty's reforms: Legalism (at that time the idea of a philosophy named “Legalism” may not have existed; this word is something historians made up afterwards…). I will go into more detail about what Legalism is in a dedicated post about the religions of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period, but since this is a very “brief” overview, this is the short version: At the core of Legalism is the belief that people are naturally selfish and short-sighted (very positive…). Therefore, legalists believed in using laws to lead society by exacting harsh punishments on those who didn't act correctly, and rewarding does who behaved. Compared to legalists, *Confucius* believed in the morality/goodness of people. Therefore, he believed that if the ruler of a country acted with goodwill, his people would follow his guidance and also be virtuous and moral. To achieve this goal of using laws to lead society, legalists believed in reforms that centralized power and built absolute obedience of the populous. A frequently asked question when talking about philosophy/religions is who created this philosophy/religion? The answer for Legalism is that we don’t know. Legalism has changed so much with so many philosophers adding to it that there simply isn’t a clear answer to who “created it”. Generally though, it is agreed that the representative figure of Legalism is a man named *Han Feizi (韩非子)*. *Han Feizi* is known for contributing massively to Legalism not by helping to reform a country like *Shang Yang* did, but by writing multiple books about the philosophy that is Legalism, which later on would be read and its ideas used by the first emperor of China, *Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇)*. 

**The reforms of** ***Shang Yan*****g:** Though *Shang Yang* did not make many reforms to the state of *Qin*, the reforms still had a strong and long-lasting impact. *Shang Yang*’s reforms took power away from the nobility and focused the economy on building a powerful military might to rival all of the state's enemies. Shang Yang’s Reforms:

1. **Governmental Reforms:** Establishment of the county system (县制), which made that the duke of *Qin* directly chose who was sent to govern different areas of the nation, which abolished the hereditary privileges of the nobility. Reforming the household registration (户籍) system, strengthening control on the population and where they lived. The creation of stricter laws and harsher punishments, leading to less crime.    
2. **Economical Reforms:** The abolishment of the well-field system\*\*\* (井田制) which was a system in which farmers had one plot of land where all the crops would go to them, and a central plot of land where everything would go to the government, which would then give some of the crops to the nobility. This system was ineffective because if you were a peasant, you would focus more energy on working the plot of farmland that you would get all the resources from than the one which you got nothing from. Therefore, *Shang Yang* changed the agricultural system into a system similar to the one we know today in most countries, where all land can be sold and bought freely with taxes levied by the government (yeah, China’s agricultural system hasn’t really changed much over the years). Other economical reforms were f.ex. encouraging the production of grain and cloth by removing corvee/free labor requirements for people who were farming those crops as well as uniting the measuring system (度量衡).    
3. **Military reforms:** Compulsory military service. Rewarding military service by granting titles and land-based on how many enemies you killed. This helped make people more willing and enthusiastic to fight, since at that period of time, this was one of the only ways to climb up the social ladder.The big issue with Shang Yang’s reforms, is that as we say in Chinese: he touched the nobility’s cake/碰了贵族的蛋糕 (yeah, that one was lost in translation…). Essentially, by trying to centralize the government, *Shang Yang* took a lot of power away from the nobility, and they were not thrilled. Therefore, after the death of duke *Xiao, Shang Yang* would meet a tragic death by dismemberment… (车裂).

**Tactics of the state of** ***Qin:*** Because of the reforms of *Shang Yang* and many other Legalist philosophers, the state of *Qin* gradually became the No.1 superpower in the Eastern *Zhou* dynasty. This led the other six major states to form a coalition against the nation of *Qin*. The issue with this coalition was that the six major states only formed it out of necessity, and long rivalries between some of the major states led to a very weak alliance network, which *Qin* exploited. Long story short, *Qin* allied with the states that were further away, using their help to crush the states close to *Qin*. Then, *Qin* betrayed their allies and conquered all of China. Though this strategy certainly worked, it caused the nobility of the states who were betrayed to hate the state of *Qin*, and as they were not executed because of the two crownings and three respects/二王三恪 system, these nobles would later cause issues within the *Qin* dynasty and lead to its downfall.

**Issues within the** ***Qin*** **dynasty/The downfall of the** ***Qin*** **dynasty:** There are many reasons that caused the downfall of the *Qin* dynasty, but in this post, I will only be talking about the 4 main reasons. Heavy taxation and corvée: Once the *Qin* dynasty defeated all the other warring states, it had countless infrastructure that needed repairing. On top of that, the *Qin* dynasty built great monuments and palaces that though certainly beautiful, were very expensive. To fund these projects, not only did the emperor make the populous pay absurd taxes in contrast to the *Zhou* dynasty, he also coerced the people of China into going to far-flung places to work on infrastructure, providing no labor fee. Harsh punishments and harsh laws: Though crime rates went down with fear of punishment, many of these “laws” were too strict, leading to the *Dazexiang (大泽乡)* uprising and people’s constant fear of death because of the law. Lack of new talent and the constriction of ideas: The burning of books and burying of *Confucian* scholars alive (焚书坑儒) event is a classic (by classic, I don’t mean good) example of how the *Qin* dynasty tried to unify the different schools of thought under legalism. This caused the drying up of talented officials who had innovative ideas and a growth in corrupt officials. Unhappy nobility: After the *Qin* dynasty defeated the other warring states, the nobles of these nations still had significant power, and they resented the emperor. These elements together with others brought down the Qin empire, and with it, so went legalism (kind of.., it's complicated). With the fall of *Qin* and the Legalist ideas, we can also slowly see the rise of *Confucian* ideals under the *Han* dynasty.

\* There were other smaller states than Qin in parts of the Warring States period, but they are too insignificant to talk about in this brief overview. In the Warring States period, there were seven powerful states: *Qi* (齐), *Chu* (楚), *Yan* (燕), *Han* (韩),  *Zhao* (赵),  *Wei* (魏), and *Qin* (秦).

\*\* The system of feoffment in the Zhou dynasty has similar properties to that of the western feudal system, but is not the same. Here is the link to an article that talks about this: [The differences between European feudalism and Chinese feudalism](https://www3.nd.edu/~pmoody/Text%20Pages%20-%20Peter%20Moody%20Webpage/Feudalism.pdf). 

\*\*\* The existence of such a system of servitude renting is still contested, although we have multiple written records talking about this system existing and how it functions, we are yet to find any archaeological evidence.",1656052325.0,2022-06-24 06:32:05+00:00

He showed showed remarkable talents in cultural adaptation, soon learning four languages. The khan sent Marco Polo on special missions to other parts of China, Burma, and India. In the Travels, Marco claimed he was made a member of the khan’s privy council in 1277 and served as a tax collector for three years. He wrote the famous *The Travels of Marco Polo* where he writes about unfamiliar resources and technologies: coal, asbestos, and paper currency, used since the 600s in China. 

He recounts in detail the local people’s unfamiliar ways of life, noting their customs as an early anthropologist might. He covers specific sexual practices, most notable (and to Marco’s delight) people who lent their wives to travelers.

On his deathbed in Venice in 1324,  he was urged to confess that his stories were fabrications, Marco most famously replied, “I have not told the half of what I saw!”

Besides Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta and Xuanzang are high up there as well.

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome.

Unlike its eternal rival Genoa, which was invaded by the Lombards, incorporated into the Frankish Empire, then the Holy Roman Empire, sacked by the Egyptians, etc etc, Venice was part of the Exarchate of Ravenna, the Byzantines' last remaining territory on mainland Europe west of the Balkan peninsula.

The Venetians were subjects of the Byzantine Emperor. In the 8th c. their elected leader Ursus was bestowed the titles of honorary consul (""hypatos"", hence the surname ""Ipato"") and duke (""dux"", where we get ""doge"") by Emperor Leo the Isaurian.

Charlemagne and his son both attempted to conquer it but failed. In the Pax Nicephori treaty of 803 CE, the Franks recognised it as Byzantine.

In practice, the Venetians were de facto autonomous since the 8th or 9th c. But at what point did Venice formally sever ties with the Byzantine Empire and become de jure independent (if ever)?

During the 13th c., Venice was heavily involved in the sacking of Constantinople, and seized a bunch of Byzantine territories in the Peloponnese and Aegean Sea for its empire, I imagine the split would've happened before then? Or was that the breaking point? Or did it happen with its fall in 1453?

After 1453, did the Venetians ever consider their Republic a successor-state or continuation of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (in a similar way that the Russian kings did)?

What about religious linkages? Justinian and the later Iconoclasts had no problem with trying to impose their various religious views on Venice. Was Venice ever part of the Byzantine Church or subject to the Greek Orthodox patriarch in Constantinople, or was it always part of the Latin Rite Church and subject to the Pope in Rome?

Any good books and primary texts, especially from the point of view of the Byzantines, Ottoman Turks and Ottoman Greeks, would be much appreciated.",1655771749.0,2022-06-21 00:35:49+00:00

607,"When it comes to Che Guevara's famous image, do you think the historical context of the image(the La Coubre explosion) adds any significance to the image or is it an image that stands alone culturally and ideologically?",1137,vgd5jq,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vgd5jq/when_it_comes_to_che_guevaras_famous_image_do_you/,325,"Che Guevara's image is probably one of the most famous in the 20th century. Known as the Guerillo Heroico it is the popular image of him staring stoically in the distance. That image has been reproduce millions of times over on T shirts, plaques and statues across the globe to symbolise many things ranging from defiance, to martyrdom to revolution. The historical context of the image however is what is called the ""La Coubre Explosion"".

Basically a French vessel that had left the port of Antwerp in Belgium full of munitions and landed in the harbors of Havana. Che was at a meeting of what was called the National Institution of Agrarian Reform to implement the Cuban revolution's land reform program. When the vessel exploded it ended up killing 75-100 people and wounding 200. Che was in the vacinity and drove his car to the area. Because he was a doctor by training Che personally administered first aid treatment to the victims. In the aftermath of the incident a national funeral was held. Fidel Castro presided over the funeral and many Cuban officials as well as international delegates were present. The famous French existentialist philosopher Jean Paul Sartre and his romantic partner and feminist author Simone De Beavoir were in the crowd with Che Guevara listening to Fidel Castro's speech. In this context Fidel Castro delivered a blistering condemnation of America, accusing them of being behind the sabotage of the La Coubre. There is no hard evidence for this accusation. However the context of this accusation was the deteriorating relations with the U.S during the Eisenhower Administration in 1960. Castro and Che had nationalised American industries and pursued land reform as well as stronger ties with the Soviet Union. As a result the Eisenhower Administration began the policy of economically isolating Cuba as well as plots to overthrow Castro's government by training counter revolutionary movements(Escambray Rebellion), assassination attemptions, and preparations for the Bay of Pigs which would take place in 1961. In the context of this speech when he was in the crowd of delegates with Sartre and De Beavoir Che's stoic image was caught. Since the Cuban revolutionaries believed America was behind the explosion(which we don't have definitive proof of) its almost as if Che is looking defiantly at the circumstances and also expecting the worst later on(which would happen in the Bay of Pigs).

The second interesting context that's hinted at is the French. This was a French vessel that exploded in Havana. That contextualises Sartre and Simone De Beavoir's presence. But they had visited Cuba months earlier to have philosophical discussions with Che due to the fact that French intellectuals and political activists had been fascinated by the Cuban revolution and Che himself. Che would later go on a official state visit to France in 1964 and in 1967 when he was leading his insurgency in Bolivia before execution one of the combatants in his rank was a French intellectual and philosopher named Regis Debray. Debray would eventually go to serve and be a major advisor to the French President Francois Mitterrand. Now does anyone think this historical context ads any significance to the image(regardless of what you think of Che personally) or does the image itself just stand alone?",1655700172.0,2022-06-20 04:42:52+00:00
608,How to learn and understand history?,72,vgpr2a,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vgpr2a/how_to_learn_and_understand_history/,88,"Hello! I (17Y) always liked history and it was always interesting for me to understand and visualize how a lot of events in the world were happening.  I had the opportunity to play games (such as HOI4; EU; CK2; CIV6) and read books related to a lot of different periods in history and get to laugh at memes related to history.

My attachment to history became more pronounced a year ago, and I realized that there is a lot of information that is so interesting, but at the same time so voluminous that it can be devastating to understand it without having a practical plan to learn history properly.

I would like to ask you:

1. How do you plan the process of learning history?
2. How do you make notes in a way that helps you maintaining the big picture of all events?

611,Chinese Feudalism: The Zhou Dynasty,87,veyzyb,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/veyzyb/chinese_feudalism_the_zhou_dynasty/,20,"Growing up in China, the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period of the Zhou dynasty are two of my favorite eras of Chinese history, so I wanted to share this time period with you guys. Most people I know focus on the many cultural, educational, agricultural, and religious innovations during the Zhou Dynasty, so instead, I will focus more on the military and governance aspects in this post.

**The** **Zhou Dynasty (周朝) and the periods it is divided into:** The Zhou dynasty, like most long-lasting Chinese dynasties, is divided into two different periods: Western and Eastern Zhou dynasty. At the end of the Western Zhou dynasty, a tribe of nomadic peoples invaded the capital, killing the current Zhou king\* named You Wang (周幽王). Because of this, the Zhou dynasty moved their capital from Xi’an to Luoyang (both of these are classic capitals of the Chinese dynasties), and placed a new king named Ping Wang (周平王) on the throne. The issue with this new king was that he only had power in name, essentially being a puppet emperor. From this period onwards we start a “new” dynasty: The Eastern Zhou dynasty (this dynasty is itself divided into two periods that will be mentioned below).[ Zhou Dynasty Illustration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ynLCxEh-KKcvmH_mRpkZKaqxdsq_qEJl9njfwSyjPZo/edit?usp=sharing)

**What is special about the Zhou Dynasty?** The Zhou dynasty was the third or second (this is debated) dynasty in Chinese history, lasting from 1050–221 BCE. One of the main attributes of the Zhou dynasty is a new system of governance instituted by King Wu (the Zhou dynasty’s first king). The idea of this decentralized state system was to give land to many different nobles, stabilizing the kingdom and making it easier to govern. This also gave the Zhou dynasty the ability to expand the amount of land controlled, as the administrative problems could be solved locally by this system of feoffment\*\*(分封制)

**The downsides of the Chinese feudal system:** Although this system had many benefits, it also had some crucial downsides which would later lead to the collapse of the Zhou dynasty. Over the centuries the Zhou dynasty ruled (the Zhou dynasty is the longest-lasting dynasty of Chinese history, so it ruled for quite long), the nobles became more and more powerful, slowly building sizable armies. The first batches of nobles who were given the land by the King of Zhou might have had qualms fighting him, the descendants of those nobles though, were not as loyal. This gradually led to what is called the Spring and Autumn period. During this time period, the king of Zhou was therefore only king in name, having minimal land (personally controlled) and power.

**The Spring and Autumn period:** The Spring and Autumn period lasted from approximately 770 to 476 BCE, while the Warring States period lasted from 476 to 221 BCE. These two periods that are part of the Eastern Zhou dynasty are marked by a change in power of the vassal states. In the Spring and Autumn period, everyone still cared about the mandate and power of the king, following his rules. If they wanted to fight wars against other vassal states, they used the justification of “defending” the king. Furthermore, traditional rite of war was mostly followed. For example, fighting with relatively ""fair conditions"" was the “honorable” way, and there were many stories of generals refusing to attack when the enemy was not in position yet. Another example would be that depending on the rank of the feudal lords, a feudal lord might only be permitted to field a certain amount of troops.

**The Warring States period:** Once we reach the Warring States period, everyone stopped paying attention to the king. Feudal lords openly fought each other without justification. The goal was to defeat the enemy and become king themselves, so any strategy that could achieve that goal became valid. Massive reforms were also commonplace in the Warring States period, with many states changing from a slave-based agricultural system (which was the norm at that time) to a feudal-type system (that doesn’t mean slavery was abolished though, that would take another 2000 years).

**Army sizes:** The final important difference between the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period was army size. Agricultural advancements, advances in metallurgy, and the increasing size of the vassal states (which had absorbed other smaller states) led to significant increases in army sizes. During the Spring and Autumn period, armies had not surpassed several 10,000 troops. In the Warring States period though, armies reached more than several 100,000 troops (these numbers may be exaggerated, since we don’t know how reliable our sources are).

I hope you liked this brief overview, and that you might want to discover more about this fascinating era of Chinese history!

\*I use king instead of emperor in this post because that is what everyone at that time called their rulers. The Chinese word for emperor (皇帝) was created only after the collapse of the Zhou dynasty by the first ruler of the Qin dynasty: Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇).

\*\*This system should not be equated with the much later occurring European contractual feudalism, which has certain distinctions to the Zhou Dynasty's lineage feudalism.",1655529233.0,2022-06-18 05:13:53+00:00
612,"A widely believed history myth: No, ""true"" Damascus steel is not a ""lost art""",6772,vdvtrh,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/vdvtrh/a_widely_believed_history_myth_no_true_damascus/,412,"Because it has come up repeatedly over the last week on subreddits I moderate, I thought I'd revise and repost this quick explainer on the very prolific myth that ""true"" damascus steel is a lost art.


First of all, let's clarify what I mean when I say ""True Damascus Steel"", because it is very easy to become mired in definitions and ambiguity.

[Top: Ottoman Pala, Pattern welded. Bottom, Iranian Shamshir, Crucible steel.](https://preview.redd.it/oj7m6y0k3e591.jpg?width=6733&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be106e56821267c4dfb0c9c1707143f878f62c87)

**""Damascus steel"" usually refers to two main types of steel**:

The most common you'll see made today is ""**pattern-welded steel**"", where alternating layers of nickel rich and nickel deplete steel are stacked, forge welded, and **folded** or manipulated to create a pattern. The blade is then polished and etched to reveal the layers. While modern pattern welded blades typically use nickel containing steels to maximise contrast, historically this was not the case.

This method of construction using stacked, folded or otherwise forge welded, dissimilar* steels is how the majority of sword steels were made, worldwide, until advances in technology allowed for the use of more homogenous steel products. Pattern welding, and variants such as multibar patterns and laminated blades, were used widely and includes swords like spatha, “viking” swords, katana and more. It is worth noting that even ""monosteel"" swords which were made without the use of dissimilar steel, but still made from bloomery or refined blast furnace steel, were also subject to similar stacking, folding and forge welding techniques.

*Bloom is here considered to contain multiple dissimilar steels due to the heterogeneous nature of bloom. 

This description of pattern welding and forge consolidated steels is intentionally simplified as they are not the focus of todays post, however for more information - particularly on bloomery and blast furnace production of steels - I recommend ""The Knight and the Blast Furnace"" by Alan Williams.

In the present day, this is the type you will see chef’s knives, swords, and even pocket knives being made of, and it can range from being rather cheap to incredibly expensive depending on the materials and workmanship.

[Pattern welded Pala blade in \\""Turkish Ribbon Twist\\"" style.](https://preview.redd.it/ijgu7seo3e591.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=630b2d095047fcd34d73f1e37c87db156a4f195a)

The other type of ""Damascus Steel"" is a form of hypereutectoid, pattern forming **crucible steel.**

And that is what I will be discussing today.

It is a hypereutectoid steel, which means that it has over 0.8% carbon by definition. It is formed by liquifying steel in a crucible, and is **NOT** **produced by folding** or layering steel. The typical composition is around 1% to 2% carbon, which by modern standards makes this an “ultra-high carbon steel”, often abbreviated as UHCS.

It is formed by melting steel with specific impurities in a crucible (historically, made of high kaolin content clay, rice husks as chaff, quartz sands, and other additives), and the process of turning this crucible “charge” into steel is quite complicated, with the potential for failure to produce an attractive pattern being high if any part of the process is not conducted correctly.

In summary, the crucible charge is brought up to melting temperature, and held at this temperature for a while, allowing the constituent alloying elements present in the steel to spread and bubbles to boil out. It is then slowly cooled, before the ingot is removed, roasted to decarburise the rim, drawn out into a bar, manipulated to produce a surface pattern with ball peens, wedges and grinding, and finally forged it into a blade, and thermally cycled.

As stated, this steel is typically the range of carbon content is between 1 and 2% in historical examples, and thus melts in a temperature range between 1200 and 1400c (for more information, see “iron carbon phase diagrams”). It must also have sufficient levels of carbide formers (vanadium, molybdenum, manganese etc) in order to form patterns (Verhoeven et al, 1998,. Verhoeven et al 2018).

The pattern in crucible steel are formed by ""rafts"" of steel rich in carbide formers, where ultra-hard cementite spheroids form over subsequent forging cycles, which etch bright, and areas devoid of carbide forming elements (CFEs), which remain as pearlite, a soft mix of carbides which etches dark. The shape and size of the rafts is determined by the length of dendrites that form during the slow cooling of the ingot, as dendritic regions of the steel are carbide former depleted, and interdendritic regions are carbide former rich (Verhoeven et al, 2018).

[Crucible steel shamshir blade, kara Khorasan pulad](https://preview.redd.it/rbchxn5t3e591.png?width=8091&format=png&auto=webp&s=6081374d34827d01a9493c3673aeddc09372cbb0)

Many people conflate pattern-welded steel with crucible steel, and call both “Damascus”. Whilst this is accepted in colloquial language, it is important to distinguish between the two – particularly when it comes to identifying antiques, or documenting them.

""Damascus"" can therefore be used to refer to either pattern welded, or crucible steels, as both are pattern-forming steels, but it is best to specify which sort of ""Damascus"" is being discussed. The term has been used historically to describe both pattern-welded steel and crucible steel. Many swords and gun barrels made in germany were marked ""damastahl"" in the 18th and 19th century, and they were pattern welded, so there is historical precedent for such a naming convention, but the two techniques (and end products) are very different.

**To be ABSOLUTELY CLEAR: ""True"" damascus steel is herein used as a term to refer to historical, patterned crucible steel. I am using this term entirely because it is understandable. The correct naming and etymology is discussed later. Both pattern welded and crucible steel blades can be called ""damascus"", and were historically, but the ""lost"" form is the crucible steel form.**

**The Myth: ""Damascus Steel is a Lost Art"":**

The is quite a long history of crucible “Damascus” steel, in the form of primary sources in which the process was written down - as early as 350BCE - 420BCE Zosimus, an early alchemist in Alexandria, wrote the following:

>""The tempering of Indian Iron: Take 4 pounds of soft iron, and the skins of myrobalans, called elileg, 15 parts; belileg, 4 parts; and two parts of glassmakers magnesia. Then place it into a crucible and make it level. .... Put on the charcoal and blow the fire until the iron becomes molten and the ingredients become united with it. ... Such is the premier and royal operation, which is practiced today and by means of which they make marvelous swords. It was discovered by the Indians and exploited by the Persians"".

This is by no means the only method to make crucible steel - some was co-fusion, using both cast iron and bloom, while some was indeed made with bloomery and carbon bearing material (often plants).

Incidentally, the oldest known crucible steel sword is from the 6th to 3rd century BCE and was found interred in a megalithic site in Thelunganur, Tamil Nadu, India (Ramesh et al, 2019) and daggers from \~500BCE have been found with the associated production site in Kodumanal, Tamil Nadu (Sasisekaran & Rao, 1999. Sasisekaran, 2002). This is consistent with the Zosimus account describing the technique as discovered by India.

[Thelunganur sword, Ramesh et al 2019](https://preview.redd.it/cfthvr2f4e591.jpg?width=2128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8141215372f59d840de48a1f9237b31689535a4)

The Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi - circa 800CE - 873CE) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni - circa 973CE - 1048CE) both wrote detailed procedures for the production of crucible steel, too.

⁠This is how Biruni described it in the manuscript Al-Jamâhir Marefat al-Jawâher. (From Khorasani et al, 2013):

>“He says that they \[ironwokers\] include five ratl رطل of \[horse\] shoes, the nails of which are made of narmâhan نرمآهن\] in the crucible\].

When he \[the person sitting next to the smith\] looked closely, he saw that the smith was hammering and mixing dus دوص with narmâhan نرمآهن the same way they made iron ingots (eggs) in Herat.”

The metallurgical research into how this steel gets its patterns spans back far, with Michael Faraday (yes, that Faraday) having published a paper on recreating Indian crucible steel (known to him as wootz) in 1819, with subsequent papers in 1820 and 1822. It wasn't until 1837 when Pavel Anasov, a Russian metallurgist and director of the Zlatoust arms factory, that it was successfully recreated in any substantial quantity. Since then, research has been done on modern steels (Sherby and Wadsworth, 1983) and on historical blades, revealing the mechanisms by which the patterns forms (Verhoeven et al, 1998).

Anosov was a metallurgist and Colonel of the Russian Army during the occupation on the Emirate of Bukhara in the 1820’s, when he established contact with steelmakers in the region and attempted to recreate the steel in his steelworks in Zlatoust, but after failing asked Captain Massalski (results published 1841) whose regiment was stationed there, to observe the process and undertake further observations.

Massalski documented the Bukhara method, noting 3 key metals, cast iron, iron, and silver. Massalski stresses the ratio of one part iron, 3 parts cast iron (N.B: a co-fusion method of making steel with the right amount of carbon) and the crucibles hold around 2.5kg of steel, making up 1/3rd of the potential capacity of the crucible.

The metal workers start the fire and the metal begins to melt after some 5 to 6 hours, and makes a bubbling sound. When the bubbling sound ends, this is a sign that the fusion has ended. The workers remove the lid, add 0.013kg to 0.017kg of silver, stir rapidly with an iron rod, cover the charge with charcoal, and cover again with the lid. (N.B: this was a potentially primitive form of ""killing"" the steel, a process by which reactive elements in the charge react with another reactive metal - silver in this case, aluminium in modern times - and are thus removed from the reaction, resulting in less porosity due to gas production. The other method of degassing historically used was simply holding the ingot at the molten, liquidus temperature for longer). 

* N.B: Silver is not particularly reactive, so the purpose of silver might not have been killing the steel. The atmosphere and composition of a crucible melt, as well as the 1400-1500c temperature at which silver was added require further investigation to determine the mode of action. it may be that the liquid silver was moving into the grain boundaries of the steel during solidification, displacing phosphorus or sulphur.

They return the crucible to the fire and allow it to cool as the charcoal burns out, slowly, over 3 days. After cooling, the ingot is removed and tested by polishing to check for dendrites. The steel then passes to smiths, who “know that from then onwards whether the ingot survives being forged is a matter of luck”

This is clear evidence that not only was the crucible steel production process being conducted in Bukhara in 1841, but that the mechanisms of pattern formation were already being formally investigated. And this is by far not the most recent ethnographic account of crucible steel manufacture.

In Mawalgaha, Sri Lanka, Ananda Coomaraswamy documented crucible steel production in 1903 – (Coomaraswamy, A. (1908): Medieval Sinhalese Art. Pantheon Books, New York, Juleff et al 2009). He found two crucible ingot fragments, crucibles, iron blooms and small iron bars. The two crucible ingot fragments were collected from the Mawalgaha village, where Kiri Ukkuwa demonstrated how to make steel for Coomaraswamy – providing the most recent known eyewitness evidence for crucible steel manufacturing.

This form of ""Damascus"" steel was therefore historically used as early as the 6th century BCE (Park et al 2019) and as late as 1841 when Massalski recorded crucible steel production in Bukhara, leading to the production of Bulat in Zlatoust by Anosov, and 1903 in Sri Lanka (though it was not actively being made en masse, and was only demonstrated using previously abandoned equipment).

**In summary: Production between 1903ish, and 1980ish, was virtually halted, thus leading to the myth of it being a ""lost art"", however as will be shown in this document, the process was well documented and has since been replicated.**

The result is that there are now upwards of 150 individuals (at least, that I know of) who can produce crucible steel with an accurate metallurgical composition, which naturally form patterns in the steel due to carbide segregation. It is structurally, functionally and visually identical to historical crucible steel - and can only be differentiated by analysing the amount of radionuclides in the steel, as all historical steel is low background steel, and modern recreations are typically not.

Because I recognise that many people are visual learners, here is a comparison of antique crucible steel from an Iranian shamshir in my collection, and modern crucible steel (made by Niko Hynninen).

&#x200B;

**Etymological information on ""Damascus"" steel:**

Utsa / Wootz (Sanskrit- and mistranslated Sanskrit), Urukku (Tamil) Pulad (Persian), Fuladh (Arabic), Bulat (Russian), Polat (Turkish) and Bintie (Chinese) are all names for ultra-high carbon crucible steel typified by carbide segregation, which can be otherwise referred to as ""crucible damascus steel"". The modern term “wootz” first appears around 1794 in writings by Sir Joseph Banks, who mistranslated Sanskrit for “utsa” as “wootz” (Dube, 2014). In the regions where crucible steel was made, and where it was forged into blades, it was not called ""damascus"". This name is primarily a medieval name, and primarily used in Europe.

The origin of the name ""Damascus"" steel is contentious - The Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi) (circa 800 AD - 873 AD) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni) (circa 973 AD - 1048 AD) were both scholars who wrote about swords and steel made for swords, based on their surface appearance, geographical location of production or forging, or the name of the smith.

There are three potential sources for the term ""Damascus"" in the context of steel.

The word ""Damas"" stems from the root word for ""water"" (""ma"") or ""broiling"" in Arabic (Sachse, 1994, 13) and Damascus blades are often described as exhibiting a water-pattern on their surface, and are referred to as ""watered steel"" not only in English but in other languages.

The second theory is geographical, as Al-Kindi called swords produced and forged in Damascus as Damascene (al-Hassan, 1978, 35) but it's worth noting that crucibl steel blades were made in many nations, and crucible steel is not known to have ever been produced in the city of Damascus. Al Kindi also describes crucible steel production using the typical term Pulad, distinct from these damascene swords, indicating that the two types are separate. It is also worth noting that Al-Kindi did not describe these swords as having pattern forming steel.

Third, Beiruni mentions a sword-smith called Damasqui who made swords of crucible steel (Said, 1989, 219-220). In a similar fashion, Al-Kindi mentions swords called “Zaydiya which were forged by a man called Zayd, and hence they were attributed to his name"". We therefore have a precedent for naming swords based on their makers, which may explain how ""Damascus"" came about.

It is my opinion that the ""watered"" hypothesis is most likely for the origin, though the popularisation of the term may have indeed occurred due to western travellers who purchased the swords in damascus, and described them thusly, as it was a massive center for trade.

**How Crucible steel gets its pattern:**

Crucible steel, as the name implies, is made in a crucible process, and requires completely liquefication of the crucible charge.

Most surviving ""recipes"" for crucible steel call for either a combination of bloomery iron, and cast iron, or the use of bloomery iron and organic carbon sources (like plant leaves) - but crucible steel recipes included other elements, like organic material - rice husks, leaves, bark - as well as shells, glass, and even silver. The trace impurities in the iron used, and in these additives, are key to the patterns they show after forging.

In order to form patterns, carbide forming alloying elements like vanadium, tungsten or manganese are necessary in small amounts, with vanadium being the most common historical alloying element. These carbide formers cause the segregation of hard cementite carbides, which form the ""white streaks"" in crucible steel.

The segregation of CFEs into interdendritic reasons is due to the differences in solidification temperature between high CFE and low CFE steel, with low CFE steel solidifying at a higher temperature than high CFE steel. This causes the low CFE steel to solidify first when the ingot is slowly cooled, and it does so by branching out into dendrities of relatively pure iron, while the impurities such as phosphorus, CFEs and sulfur get pushed into the regions between these branches.

[Dendritic structures visible on freshly made crucible ingot - image credit Peter Burt.](https://preview.redd.it/4plho3o14e591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5862b44b804955becc1428e59c7f6ad289ddfc0d)

During the forging of the crucible steel ""puck"", these carbide formers are pushed into parallel, layered sheets in the microstructure of the steel (Verhoeven et al, 1998).

[Parallel cluster sheets.](https://i.redd.it/gi70lojz3e591.gif)

Because vanadium and other CFEs do not readily dissolve at forging temperatures and do not rapidly migrate at forging temperatures, these sheets of carbide formers form distinct bands in the steel. As the steel is thermally cycled, carbides aggregate onto the CFEs via ostwald ripening, and form spheroids of cementite. The interdendritic regions without CFEs form as pearlite, a soft two-phase mixture of carbides, or sorbite, and imperfect form of pearlite. This is diagnostic of historical crucible steel (Verhoeven et al 2018, Feuerbach 2002, Feuerbach 2006).

It is worth noting that vanadium is not the only effective carbide former found in historical crucible steel blades, and other carbide formers like manganese are seen in historical examples - or even chromium as seen in Chahak, Iran (Alipour et al 2021). Additionally, the other microalloying elements in the steel can effect the contrast and spacing of the pattern, with phosporus notably increasing the contrast of the pattern after etching (Khorasani and Hynninen, 2013)

**Historical perspectives on Crucible Damascus Steel quality:**

Regarding the historical reputation of historical crucible steel swords: they were always very expensive, very desirable, and very well thought of - HOWEVER - there are accounts from the 14th century of cold-short blades (high in phosphorus) which claims that crucible steel swords are prone to breakage in cold weather.

The exact quote is by Alī ibn ʻAbd al-Raḥmān Ibn Hudhayl, translated:

>""the Hindy sabre often breaks when the weather is cold and shows itself better when the weather is warm”

Despite this, they were very valued. Mohammad ibn Abi al-Barakāt Jŏhari Nezāmi in 1196 CE states a good shamshir blade of crucible steel was valued at 100 golden Dinar (Khorasani et al, 2013).

Al-Idrisi (Full name Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Idris al-Idrisi - circa 1100CE - 1166CE) claimed that ""*nothing could surpass*"" the edge of a crucible steel sword.

Bertrandon de la Brocquiere, a Frenchman, wrote about his travels to the Middle East in 1432CE–1433CE. He wrote:

>""Damascus blades are the handsomest and best of all Syria... I have nowhere seen swords cut so excellently. They are made at Damascus, and in the adjoining country.""

Note: This is potentially the source of the (incorrect but often repeated) claim that crucible steel swords were made in Damascus.

In the early 1600's, Polish king Zygmunt III Waza ordered a Armenian merchant (Sefer Muratowicz) to purchase a number of watered steel blades from Isfahan, Persia due to their value and reputation (Muratovich et al, 1777). On this same journey, the merchant purchased carpets embroidered with the royal coat of arms, which still survive today.

Regardless of the reputation crucible steel enjoyed in its' day, the reality is that it was by nature very clean, with minimal slag - which made it less likely to break due to inclusions - and there is a lot of variation in the metallurgical composition of this steel. Some have higher carbon, or more phosphorus, and the quality varied. Heat treatment also widely varied.

Compared to bloomery steel which was folded and consolidated, it's more uniform and much lower in slag - the term for non-metallic inclusions. The same is true of refined blast furnace steel, which also requires forge consolidation after finishing the finery process.

[Microstructure of a Japanese Katana, 2% Nital etch. Note the presence slag inclusions (black) within the mostly martensitic steel. Image credit George Vander Voort](https://preview.redd.it/za28tvn36e591.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccb54d2c5b8b2d6c6265e426cb87cce2c637a83e)

&#x200B;

Crucible steel can be more brittle, depending on the heat treatment, phosphorus, and sulfur contents, or it can be much more flexible. It depends on the exact sword being analysed, as crucible steel was produced for around 2 millennia and in many places. For example, some accounts of crucible steel swords being able to be bent 90 degrees exist, however these can easily be countered with extant examples that take a set no matter the degree of bending.

**Production methods:**

Here are 4 different processes, which were recorded from at early as Al Kindi, to as late as 1841CE with Massalski - from the Deccani process used in Hyderabad, to the south Indian process, and the Isfahan process, and the Bukhara process.

There are more processes out there, I just haven't gotten around to writing them out.

**Bukhara:**

>3 parts clean iron, 1 part cast iron. Place in a crucible that is five times as tall as it the base is wide, with a mouth three times the size of the base. The weight of iron should be 2-2.5kg.  
>  
>Using a charcoal melting furnace with air venting holes, heat until melted (6 hours) or until a bubbling sound can be heard from the crucible. once bubbling stops, remove the lid of the crucible and add 0.013-0.017 grams of silver to the crucible and stir with a metal rod. reseal the crucible, seal all holes in the furnace, and allow to cool over 3 days.  
>  
>Remove the puck from the crucible, and polish one corner of it to check if the watered pattern is good. If the pattern is poor, reheat to a red heat and hold for seven minutes before allowing to cool in air.  
>  
>Forge into a bar using the top of the button to form the spine of the blade, and never heating above red.

**South Indian:**

>In a clay crucible of conical form (200mm height x 50mm diameter) add 250-500 grams of bloomery iron, as well as wood chips, rice husks, vines or leaves. Seal the crucible with a clay lid, leaving a vent hole. Allow to fully dry  
>  
>Using a bellow-fed charcoal forge, heat for 6 hours or until molten. allow the crucible to cool in the forge (some sources say to quench it in water).  
>  
>The button will have a striated appearance if everything was done correctly.

**Deccani (Hyderabad) Process:**

>Using a mixture of iron sand derived iron ore, and iron clay derived iron (mirtpalli and kondapur iron), place in a crucible with glass, sealed with clay with a vent hole. Place in a bellow powered charcoal furnace for 24 hours. The steel will melt within the first 3. After 24 hours, remove crucible and allow to cool in the air.  
>  
>Once cool, remove the buttons and cover each in clay, and anneal in a conventional forge for 12-16 hours. repeat this annealing process until the button is no longer brittle.

**Isfahan Process:**

>To a crucible, add 10% casi auriculata wood, and asclepias gigantean leaves with two parts pure iron, one part cast iron, and three parts silicate-rich iron ore up to a total weight of 200 grams.  
>  
>10-1200 of these small crucibles are heated at a time in a kiln operated with charcoal and bellows for 6 days, before the crucibles are broken open, and the buttons removed.  
>  
>The buttons are then transferred into a ""hot room"" to anneal and temper for 2 days so they do not shatter from cooling too quickly.

Authors note: I suspect that if this room is a furnace-heated compartment, and is hot enough, they also experience some level of rim decarburisation, as well as converting the microstructure of the puck to a more forgeable state compared to steel which has not been roasted.

**N.B:** A brief note on the claim **carbon nanotubes** exist in crucible steel:

The only articles that ""found"" carbon nanotubes was published as a brief communication to Nature, i.e not a peer reviewed article, not a full article. This was in 2006, and was only a few pages in length.

It later found its away into a conference paper by the same authors, still not a peer reviewed article. This was 2 pages in length. These findings should be considered preliminary.

The method used (dissolving crucible steel in acid and seeing what remains) revealed stands of carbon, but carbon dissolves VERY readily into steel. Crucible steel is typified by cementite spheroids, which often stretch into rods during forging as they are deformed. If you dissolve cementite in acid, removing the iron component, you are left with carbon.

This does not mean there was an intact carbon nanotube in the core of the cementite rod - and even if it DID mean that, it would have negligible impact on performance because it is \*encased\* in cementite, which itself is in a soft matrix of pearlite or sorbite.

But don't take my word for it. Other academics, including those who have been instrumental in understanding crucible steel (namely John Verhoeven) doubt the findings.

"" John Verhoeven, of Iowa State University in Ames, suggests Paufler is seeing something else. Cementite can itself exist as rods, he notes, so there might not be any carbon nanotubes in the rod-like structure.""

""Another potential problem is that TEM equipment sometimes contains nanotubes, says physicist Alex Zettl of the University of California""

About  five thousand years ago, in southern Mesopotamia, Sumerian craftsmen  had to solve a similar problem. They thought like us and perceived  wealth as an opportunity to go beyond their minimum needs. At the same  time, wealth for the Sumerians is to live in a world without hunger, it  is to have constant guaranteed access to a variety of food.

The  diet of a common inhabitant of Lagash or Ur consisted of cereal cakes,  boiled grains, onions, onions, and sometimes dates. The blackheads (as  the Sumerians called themselves) received vegetable oil or meat on  holidays and in connection with special events.

Therefore,  it was livestock that was a symbol of wealth and prosperity for the  ancient inhabitants of Mesopotamia. Fat herds were the subject of trade,  an offering for deities and trophies in the bloody wars between the  Sumerian city-states (nomes).

There  is no doubt that it was grain that was the basis of the entire Sumerian  civilization. Grain made it possible to feed the peasants, artisans,  warriors, merchants, priests and rulers. Not only to feed, but also to  allow the maintenance of many people who are not employed in the  household. These people invented accounting, bureaucracy, and many still  useful inventions. But with all this, in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the  goddess Inanna seduced the mighty hero Gilgamesh with the words:

*Let the sovereigns, kings and lords bow their knees,*

*May they bring you tribute from the hills and the plains,*

*Your goats give birth to triplets, and your sheep give birth to twins,*

*Let your pack donkey overtake the mule.*

We can see a similar idea of ​​wealth in ancient Sumerian artifacts:

This is not to say that the ancient  image of fat fields with grazing cattle is completely outdated, but for  most of us it is not relevant. Ownership in ancient Sumer is a debatable  issue, but most historians agree that most of the wealth was in some  form of collective community ownership (at least formally).

This  means that, looking at the string of cows on the sculptural frieze of  the local temple, the Sumerians felt their involvement in the general  wealth and prosperity of their city.

Johnson a failure on foreign policy?,58,v9q8hz,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/v9q8hz/why_do_historians_consider_lyndon_b_johnson_a/,74,"The most obvious case is his handling of the Vietnam war. I read that Kennedy was actually going to pull troops out, but when Johnson took office he kept them in. Johnson was responding to popular opinion at the time where in 1964 there was still clear support for the war. Of course it wouldn't be proper to mention Johnson's foreign policy without his Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Johnson and McNamara were responsible for a massive increase in troop levels by the time mid 1965 rolled around. This was in spite of the fact that the bombing campaigns had proven unsuccessful in the north. By late 1965 even more troops were being sent in against the poor results on the ground. It's true that Johnson was in a bind considering that not sending troops would be to admit defeat. 

By 1966, Americans were getting impatient with the war and Johnson's approval rating had dropped. Johnson was getting anxious for a decisive victory, but the bombing campaigns weren't doing it. Johnson had fleeting moments of positive press like the Manila conference, but they didn't last. During this time Johnson and McNamara were continuing to send more troops into Vietnam. It got even stranger when they were technically in secret talks with the north and still commenced bombing. In 1967, the war was clearly unpopular. The death toll was getting larger. Over 70,000 Americans had been killed or wounded by that point. McNamara by this stage had actually recommended a cap on troop sizes that Johnson was against. McNamara ended up resigning. Johnson was paranoid by this point. The FBI and CIA were targeting anti-war activists and Johnson even believed these people to be part of a communist conspiracy. The animosity to Johnson was so strong by this point that he couldn't even speak at the Democratic Convention in 1968. It was so bad that it was a reason he didn't seek his parties nomination in 1968. Johnson did try peace talks by this point, but were not substantial. Nixon himself offered far better terms in the talks effectively making Johnson a lame duck. 

So why do historians consider Lyndon B. Johnson a failure on foreign policy? This blemish on his record explains a lot.",1654923675.0,2022-06-11 05:01:15+00:00

I have been reading Niall Ferguson’s Civilization and I find it fascinating.
The more I observe politics and dive into history, the more I find important the principles of ownerships.

Comparing the cadastre shapes in Europe and America, there are evident distinctions. The same is the case of country/state borders. While observing the state borders (USA) I woul conclude the straight lines are the evidence the states weren’t fighting but the borders were arranged. The same is with cadastre blocks. The people that came from Europe were provided with certain block of certain size in exchange for labor.

In Europe, I don’t know what were the principles for granting people land (and taking it back). Was there any case of government redistributing private land in certain circumstances (excepting communist regimes)?

I live in ex communist country and many people over here still advocate communist ideas of redistributing ownership by applying ‘fair share’. By the historical evidence known to me, I can’t find the example of such case in which society as a whole benefited long term.

On one hand I believe people should have right to freely access to the sea and drinking water but I believe it is also fair to award those who turn the wild coast to usable beach and enable the rest to drink water without digging themselves.

So actually the question is were there different principles that determined the relationship of inheritance, labor, and ownership, such as free market and something else or were there any other rules throughout different societal structures that laid foundations for today’s free market?",1654417591.0,2022-06-05 08:26:31+00:00

King and three friends were chased from an all white establishment by the proprietor, who shot a gun of into the air when the group refused to leave and said ""I'll kill for less"".

In 2020, the NJ DEP sent me a denial letter, which included the opinion of two historians, opinions that were used without the authors permission.  Both of the historians have since written a letter of support to place the home where Dr. King planned his first protest from on the historic registry., but NJ authorities still refuse to accept their expert opinions.

A couple of weeks after NJ denied the application in 2020, I found the holy grail in the study of the research of Dr. King, which was the date and time of the speech that was given by Dr. Mordecai Johnson.  Not only did I locate the date and  time, which had gone unknown since the study of King began, but I found the correct location of the event, which was previously thought to be held ""at the Fellowship House"", but it was not.  The Fellowship House, which was an organization dedicated to bringing equality amongst the races and sexes, sponsored a monthly speakers series that took place during 1950, at the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia.

We now know the date, time and correct location of the speech that Dr. King himself, claimed to have convinced him of the methods of nonviolence that King wrote in Stride Toward Freedom that he had been searching for months for the right method, which is a passage that never made sense prior to my discovery of the date and time.  It was previously thought that the speech took place in the beginning of 1950, which was months before the event took place Maple Shade, but we now know that it happened months after the Maple Shade events fizzled out.

King had been searching for ""months"" due to the events in Maple Shade not panning out the way he had planned, so he needed a new method, one that would be effective for the social change he was trying to effect, which is exactly where the speech my Mordecai Johnson fit in.

661,The Guano Islands Boom kickstarted US imperialism (and other things),165,uxxivh,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/uxxivh/the_guano_islands_boom_kickstarted_us_imperialism/,69,"I think that the Guano Boom should be talked about a lot more than it currently is- in everyday conversations and academia. Not only is it an interesting little tidbit of history, but it has so many intersections of topics, struggles, and themes that it becomes even more relevant for study.

**Background/reasons/context**

The Inca were the first to use guano, hundreds of years before the Europeans discovered how useful a substance bird/bat poop is. Guano’s use as a fertilizer was so important to the Incas that they even had mythology surrounding the islands. Much of this was documented by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the descendant of an Incan and a Spanish conquistador. De la Vega even noted down the strict laws that surrounded the Guano Islands:

* Going to the guano islands during mating season was punishable by death
* Killing the seabirds of the guano islands anytime of the year was punishable by death
* Each Incan province was assigned a guano island where every village and householder would get a part equal to the amount they would need. This was to end the privatization of the guano.

The initial Europeans in the region focused more on finding gold than in discovering why the natives like bird poop so much. It wasn’t until Alexander von Humboldt, a Prussian geographer, who had taken samples of guano back to Europe with him to give to Pourcroy and Vanquelin. These Parsian chemists there realized that guano was very rich in nitrogen and was an excellent fertilizer. However it wasn’t popularly used as a fertilizer until Mr. Skinner, the editor of American Farmer, sent out samples of guano in the states in 1824. Europe didn’t get to try it until 1840, when England received 20 barrels of guano.

Europe and the United States were faced with depleting topsoil. There was a large demand for effective fertilizer, with people buying into recommendations of using human pee and sawdust. However, none of these were as good as guano. It was such an effective fertilizer that the size of the crops grown with it feared many farmers. Regardless, the age of Guano had arrived.

**Labor**

Guano harvesting was physically demanding. So, like in many other situations where someone with capital deems it necessary for a strenuous task to be performed, someone ends up getting exploited for labor. Slaves were made of the Chinese, Polynesian, and Easter Islanders to harvest the guano. Many were kidnapped, and the adult populations of many of these islands were severely reduced. The labor was tough. Guano dust was rampant, causing people to choke and develop respiratory issues. The guano islands had no natural anchorage, meaning that the enslaved miners had to paddle boats to the ships. The water had sharks and was turbulent. There were minimal drinkable water sources.  Rats got into the food supplies and would bite workers. The conditions were so bad that guards had to be placed around the shores so the slaves would not commit suicide.

**Leading up to the Guano Islands Act of 1856**

Journalists reported on the labor issues occurring in the Guano Islands with sensational stories. The labor issues occurring in the guano islands also brought the public's attention to the Peruvian monopoly on Guano and the trade deal they had with the British. There was an anxiety over the limited amount of guano in Europe and the Americas. Peru was able to claim a monopoly and worked out a trade deal with Britain. Americans did not like this. President Millard Fillmore addressed this issue in his State of the Union address in 1850, stating that “Peruvian guano has become so desirable an article to the agricultural interest of the United States that it is the duty of the Government to employ all the means properly in its power for the purpose of causing that article to be imported into the country at a reasonable price.” Congress passed the Guano Islands Act in 1856.

**Analyzation of the act itself: the language and the implications of it**

The act itself has a lot of very interesting language that have had many serious implications.

* The first is that the act declared that the president could direct the navy to protect claims to guano islands.
* It also declared that, “Nothing in this chapter contained shall be construed as obliging the United States to retain possession.” There was no intention of incorporating these territories.

**How the Guano Islands Act shaped the modern world**

Along with the other technological advancements that were concurrently occurring, the guano boom greatly contributed to the creation of the modern agroindustrial complex. The standard of living doubled as a result of the increased amount of food available.

The Guano Islands Act is also the first act of US imperialism and kickstarter America’s imperialist adventures. It was the first time territorial expansion was done not on the mainland and it was the first time that the expansion had no intention of incorporation as well. It set a precedent that wasn’t legally solidified until the Navassa Revolt and the following Jones v US (1890). I’m not going to get too much into that because while it is very interesting, it is a lot of legal jargon that I don’t have the time to read through and decipher to write here. I would still recommend looking into it because it A brief summary is that Haiti and the US both wanted Navassa and both claimed it as theirs. The US allowed the claim because it did not recognize the Haitian government at the time. Slaves at the island revolted against their enslavers, 4 of them were killed. 43 of the enslaved workers were charged with crimes in Jones v US. A lot went down in that trial, with Jones’s lawyer questioning the constitutionality of the guano island act and if the US government had jurisdiction over Navassa. The court’s ruling set the legal precedent for US court jurisdiction over future imperial holdings.

**What the Act connects (concepts, ideas, patterns, etc)**

The Guano Boom is a truly interesting phenomena, as I previously stated, because of the multitude of intersections between so many events, concepts, and greater historical themes. There are many, but I’ll briefly touch on some of them here

1. California Gold Rush

Many people migrated to California during the gold rush, and many of them used ships to get there. It was a very long journey since the Panama Canal was not yet built. The ship owners made a lot of money transporting people there, but no one wanted to go back home from California. Not wanting to have empty ships return, they realized that they picked up guano on their way back. The Guano trade wasn’t quite yet a boom, but the gold rush has made it into a boom.

1. Communism

Karl Marx’s Metabolic Rift was written during England’s second agricultural revolution. It was during this time that guano was in high demand because of its effectiveness as a fertilizer. Marx noticed the threat that soil depletion posed to capitalist society and had led to powers to imperialize sources of guano. Here he acknowledges not only the capitalist robbing the worker, but the soil as well. Marx also had a lot to say on the inhuman conditions the enslaved miners were faced with. I would also look into Liebig for more information.

1. Economic Booms

Peru benefited economically as a result of the Guano Boom. In 1853, Peru was able to be debt free through paying off their debts through the money made by the boom. The federal budget was tripled in 1860. 15 years of a guano boom had generated $150 million in revenue. This wealth created a construction boom in Peru as infrastructure was planned and built. The Guano boom unfortunately became a bust and the Peruvian economy greatly suffered as a result of this.

Disclaimer: This post is for a class assignment for my US History class. I am currently a student, so I obviously am not an expert and it is very likely that I have miswrote and not understood and explained a concept well. If you do notice any mistakes, please let me know in the comments. I do hope you enjoyed the argument I have presented! I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially since I find this to be a really interesting part of history that I have bored all my friends talking about.

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome.

664,The Root of Haiti’s Misery: Reparations to Enslavers (NY Times investigative series),1909,uwtxtq,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/uwtxtq/the_root_of_haitis_misery_reparations_to/,240,"This past weekend the New York Times published a series of articles called *The Ransom*, where they claim to have new research showing the true scale of Haiti's enforced reparations to France, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars that would otherwise have resulted in tens of billions more available for infrastructure and schools.

I, for one, was never taught why Haiti was so much poorer than its neighbors. I knew only that they had won their freedom through the slave revolt, and had no idea that France came back later with new warships to demand ransom as ""reparations"" to the former slave-holders, which lasted for generations. As the debts (actually a double-debt, as France offered them a usurious loan to ""help"" them pay their debt) finally neared a close, France then locked Haiti's national bank into a system where they could syphon money off of every transaction back to France, making it impossible to build the country.

Then an American bank, which would later become Citigroup, muscled its way in, buying up a controlling share of the national bank, and continuing the process of syphoning money out of every Haitian transaction. A few years later, that bank was one of the main instigators of the United State's occupation of Haiti, where more wealth was extracted.

This series was eye-opening for me, and well done (although it is one of those Times articles with funky scrolling to show you different images and documents as you scroll, which isn't for everyone but I thought it worked pretty well here. It doesn't always work well in the archive.org links, though). I'm interested to know how it compares to other expert views (or non-expert).

Did Romania lose both World Wars, yet gained territory in the aftermath of each?",905,uvujbt,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/uvujbt/diplomatic_genius_did_romania_lose_both_world/,63,"Through the Paris Peace Conference of 1919–1920 and the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947, Romania gained decent amounts of land, compared to its state right before the war. It doubled in size after WW1, and 16,500 sq miles after WW2.

What's debatable (through solid efforts of Romanian diplomacy) is who's side was Romania on in each war and did it actually lose in each of them. 

In WW1, Romania delayed entering the war for 2 years and negotiated extensively with both sides. After being forced, through an ultimatum, Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary. Over the next few months, Central Powers forces occupied nearly 2/3 of Romania's territory, prompting Romanian-German negotiations, which resulted in the Treaty of Bucharest (1918). The treaty respected Romania's independence required Romania's assistance to Central Powers in the war and awarded Romania more territory (what an interesting way to lose) through the union with Bessarabia. Despite the treaty being de facto active, and its terms being followed, Romanian king Ferdinand delayed the royal ratification.

The day, before WW1 ended, Romania re-declared the war on Central Powers, formally retaining the status of an ally of the Entente. But was it?

During the Paris Peace Conference of 1919–1920 that followed, Romania **gained 60,000 square miles of land and 8,500,000 inhabitants**.

In WW2, despite being an active Axis participant, and being named a defeated side in the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty, Romania had **Northern Transylvania (16,643 sq miles and a population of 2,577,260 before the war) recognized as its integral part**.



**!!! Clarification:**
I specifically wanted to compare its territories right before, and after joining the war. Because, if we start looking at what happened before/between the wars, the territorial disputes can be traced way back to Balkan Wars, then to 19th century, etc.

Romania did lose a large portion of its territories in 1940 (Molotov ultimatum of 1940, Second Vienna Award, Treaty of Craiova), but was NOT involved in WW2 at the time, thus making it an interwar diplomatic issue.

The Drevlians, murderers of Olga’s husband, the king of the Kievan Rus, sent ambassadors to demand she marry their prince since her son and heir was only three years old. She had the ambassadors buried alive. Without revealing what she had done, she asked her enemies for a delegation of important men to escort her. She had them burned alive.

Still concealing her actions, she asked for a funeral feast at her husband’s grave on enemy territory. She invited her enemies to the feast and served strong drinks. When her enemies were drunk she and her small retinue slaughtered them and returned to Kiev.

She then went to war and besieged the city where her husband had been killed. She was victorious in the field but the city held out for a year. Finally she offered peace for a small price, three pigeons and three sparrows from each house. A relieved city accepted. 

She then instructed her army to attach a piece of sulfur wrapped in cloth to each bird, set the sulfur on fire, and release the birds. The birds returned to their homes and set the city on fire everywhere at once, so the flames could not be put out. Olga’s army killed or captured all who escaped the flames, and her revenge was complete.

Despite her bloody history as regent for her son, Olga became a saint by converting to Christianity and doing what she could to convince her son and people to convert as well. Her son refused but after her death her grandson agreed and the Kievan Rus became Christian. Saint Olga is a patron of widows and converts. 

Some call her the patron saint of vengeance, but that appears to be an unofficial title since vengeance isn’t really in keeping with Christian teachings. Nevertheless, her legend lives on.

In the movie *The Northman* there’s a broad hint that the main character’s daughter will be Saint Olga, a rare woman on the tree of kings. Saint Olga was said to be of Viking origin.

670,Good or Bad? The Impacts Of WW1 On Canada,10,uw6lsk,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/uw6lsk/good_or_bad_the_impacts_of_ww1_on_canada/,18," 

The First World War had a mostly negative impact on Canada because of declines in the agricultural sector and poor treatment of non-Western European people in Canada. The war to end all wars led to the plunge of the farming sector in Canada, and factories had a prominent role to play in this. Non-Western Europeans were not liked in Canada, and the great war turned hatred against them into paranoia, which led to their poor treatment. The great war had a positive impact too, like the recognition of the contributions made by women during the war.

The great war hurt Canada because it led to the agricultural sector's decline in Canada. More and more factories were being built, and the factories of the Imperial Munitions Board employed 250,000 men and 50,000 women. A historian named William Young said in the article, ""After the fighting, a nation changed,"" ""The high wages paid by the new munitions factories seemed to exercise an almost irresistible attraction for the comparatively underpaid agricultural laborer's who flooded to the cities to work."" Prime Minister Borden allowed farmers' sons to be exempt from conscription, but this promise was broken, further worsening the employment crisis in the agricultural sector. This led to less agricultural production, which put the sector into a decline. A vital component of war was now in short supply.

Non-Western Europeans were not liked in Canada, and World War I caused hatred for them to skyrocket. German speakers, people from the Austro-Hungarian empire, and Ukrainians were thought to be disloyal to Canada. This hatred only escalated when a lot of people faced internment because of their ethnicity. In May of 1919, there was a huge strike in Winnipeg, which increased paranoia and made it seem that capitalism and good order were under attack. This made Canada have fear and unrest as the nation was getting so divided, that ethnicities were getting spied on for fear of rebellion similar to Russia’s 1917 Bolshevik revolution.

The way women contributed to Canada allowed them to get rights after the war had ended. Before the war, women were housewives while men were the workers, but when the war came, though they had lower wages than men, they filled the positions of men. This allowed women to show their abilities and since this was a major change, it attracted the government’s attention. Women were seen more in the workplace, though later on in the war the amount of women in the workplace returned to pre war levels. In 1917, during the Canadian elections, women, especially those that had relatives on the front, were allowed to vote. Even though it was a political move, this eventually led to the permanent right for all women to vote in 1918. These contributions led to the government recognizing women's efforts, paving the way for the call for more women's rights.

World War I had a bad impact on Canada because of the decline of the agricultural sector and more hatred against non-Western European people in Canada. Hatred and agricultural insecurity resulted in a slew of setbacks for Canada. There were some positive impacts too, and one that I have talked about is the increase in rights for women. World war one had a lot of positives. The positives of World War one show that, there are many negatives to World War one, but sometimes great sacrifices yield future gains.

I'm aware of the multitude of Gods, and the worshipping that would take place and certain rituals. I'm more referring to the understanding of the Gods relationship with humans.

I read somewhere for example that people believed they all had a bit of Zeus's blood within themselves? Which may speak to them also having the potential to be God-like possibly? Just sort of hypothesizing here.

Did the Greeks view the Gods as something completely external from themselves? Or were the Gods also a part of them in a sense? Were they something that Greeks thought literally existed, but also spoke to more symbolic aspects of life at the same time, being more allegorical, symbolic for different morals and values Greeks pursued?

Hello,

I noticed that many military backpacks from the late 1800s and early 1900s were often square with wooden frames (ex: German 'Tournister'). That kind of design seems to completely disappear in later years from what I can tell. Any idea what the logic behind the square+frame design was and why it fell out of use?

* **American Revolution**, also called **United States War of Independence** or **American Revolutionary War**,
* The war started April 19, 1775 – September 3, 1783 and america was declared there independent  on July 4, 1776 the war lasted 8 years
* The main cause of the war was taxes and a lack of representation, but there was other reason
* [Parliament](http://www.parliament.uk/)  wanted the american colonist to pay for the [French and Indian War](https://www.ncpedia.org/colonial/french-and-indian-war), 
* In order for the [Parliament](http://www.parliament.uk/) to try to get the colonist to pay for the war they pass taxes a year after the war in 1764 with the Sugar Act. and the [Stamp Act](https://www.ncpedia.org/stamp-act) a year later which basically cause the American Revolution
* The american colonist revolt started small and peaceful with boycott and protest but eventually turn into war 
* The colonist used anyone who was willing to fight in their war as soldier, including regular civilian

The only explanation I can think of that make sense to me is that this link is just wrong, but I am new to this field!

I do know that he would play up his ‘exotic’ ancestry for characteristic showboating, but not much beyond that. So, how did British Jews perceive him? Especially the large families like the Rothschilds, did he actively keep a distant for fear of encouraging anti-semitism against his own person? Was he seen as an ally or a traitor?

This city became... better? The Byzantine emperor Anastasius Romeus grants the Frankish king Clovis the titles of patrician and proconsul. An important event. Gundobad repels an attack by the Franks. Gundobad's assassination of Godegisel. Gundobad becomes the only king. The Ephthalites capture the Jamna-Gangetic valley, the Indus valley, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Kathiawar and parts of Central India. Coup d'état in the Qi Empire. Siege of the palace. The ruler of the northern edge of the Qi was handed over to the Wei Empire. Triumph of the pro-Chinese party in Gaochan and dissolution of its alliance with Zhuzhan. Does all this make sense after 1,000 years?",1651915652.0,2022-05-07 09:27:32+00:00
709,Did the Medieval Romans Abolish Slavery?,347,uj9aio,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/uj9aio/did_the_medieval_romans_abolish_slavery/,116,"According to Helene Glykatzi-Ahrweiler, a well-known Greek-French Byzantinologist, who has produced a large bibliography of historical books concerning the Medieval Roman Empire, and who was also a Principal of the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne between 1976 and 1981 (first woman to achieve this) and currently is a corresponding member of the Academia in Britain, Greece, Germany, Bulgaria and Belgium, and has a number of honorary doctorates and numerous decorations from the French State, that might be the case.

In her book ""Γιατί το Βυζάντιο"" (Why Byzantium), released in Greece in 2010 (which to my knowledge has not yet been translated to English), she claims that in the context of Christian philanthropy, projected by the emperorship as a high moral virtue which they aimed to express in their external policies, and particularly peacemaking, the Byzantines were led to abolish legal slavery in the 12th century AD. She offers a passage written by Eustathios of Thessalonica, where he writes ""God calls us all sons, yet we dare to debase our brothers in the level of slaves"", which she claims was written to the Roman Emperor Manuel Komnenos, who had issued legal guarantees for the personal liberties of the Byzantines.

Now, there are some contemporary statements from the time period which might be what she is referring to, but do not exactly speak of a widespread abolition of slavery. For example, in “Slavery in the Black Sea Region, c.900–1900: Forms of Unfreedom at the Intersection between Christianity and Islam” by Felicia Roşu we read that Eustathios of Thessalonica praised the Roman Emperor Manuel Komnenos in a funeral oration for manumitting all the slaves in the Capital (New Rome), including all those who came from beyond the Danube and the native slaves of the Pontic Steppe (today’s Ukraine and South Russia). Moving on, in “Liberty: Ancient Ideas and Modern Perspectives” by Valentina Arena, we are described how elsewhere that Ioannes Kinnamos wrote about how Manuel Komnenos also abolished a form of wage-slavery entered into by citizens because “he wanted to rule over free Romans and not slaves”.

My questioning here is the following: Did the Medieval Romans really abolish slavery? Was there a strong Roman Greek abolitionist movement, which resulted in abolition, or at least the developments described above? Did they briefly abolish slavery but later re-institute it like France? Perhaps such a re-institution was caused by the expansion of Western European slavery in the Eastern Mediterranean, through the proto-colonies that were the Crusade States (Kingdom of Jerusalem, Duchy of Antioch, Duchy of Edessa, Empire of Romania, Empire of Thessalonica etc.) and the Trade Empires (Pisa, Genoa, Venice), who engaged in extensive slave trade?",1651790477.0,2022-05-05 22:41:17+00:00

The British diverting Allied resources in a futile attempt to defend British imperial interests and that the allies would have been far better off attacking mainland Europe earlier and ignoring the Med. Which may have allowed the Western Allies to beat the Russians to Berlin.

To me, however, that view is based on 20/20 hindsight. The reality was, that before the second battle El Alamein, the allied armies had consistently struggled when facing German ground forces. In hindsight we know that the British forces had a logistical advantage that made a German victory improbable but that isn't how it seemed at the time. With the British army being consistently being driven back and suffering defeats at the hands of the Germans.

This wasn't just a problem faced by the British. The Americans were routed at Kasserine Pass and were driven back. A common occurrence when green troops, with inexperience commanders, met veterans. 

My point is, the Allied armies had an inferiority complex when facing the Germans and struggled to effectively implement combined warfare. North Africa and the Med may have been a strategic backwater but it was vital for the allies to gain both the experience and the confidence that they could defeat the German army. In hindsight we know that the German war machine was far from invincible but that was not obvious in 1942. 

I doubt that an earlier focus on mainland Europe would have been wise. A green American army and a British army which was still learning how to fight a modern war, against the forces Germany had in Europe, would have been a recipe for disaster.",1651781744.0,2022-05-05 20:15:44+00:00

As you might know, Malta holds a very important place in the history of EOD. Between 1940 and 43 over 15,000 tonnes of bombs fell on an island merely 27 km long and 14km wide. At one point it was technically the 'most bombed place on earth'. It is said that about 15% of those bombs did not detonate. The EOD ('UXB') team on the island during the war disposed of more than 7,000 bombs in two years with a team never exceeding one or two officers and 16 NCOs and sappers.

Over the past few months, my reenactment group has been restoring and researching bomb disposal in Malta during the war, which is very interesting and has affected Royal Engineers' bomb disposal in general greatly. I will attach some pictures of the original equipment below as well as a link to an article we wrote for anyone that wants to know more!

Are these myths created independently of one another or do some have common origins?**

As an Australian, I find our aboriginal folklore to be pretty fascinating. It's very spiritual and very supernatural, containing spirits and demons and god-like beings. A pretty common figure among them is the rainbow serpent, said to have formed the features of the Earth and governed the first animals and people in what is known as *The Dreamtime*. Whats so interesting about this civilisation is that they were pretty well disconnected from the rest of the world for thousands of years. It's not unlikely that any remnants of culture from their initial migration were forgotten. They were a nomadic people prior to western settlement. They would leave their mark in caves and on rock faces with ochre painting, a technique so rudimentary yet so long-lasting that we still have vivid ancient rock art today, some specimens being dated to as old as 17,000 years.

Hey all, just want to make a mini review of this book. There are two things that sets this book apart from the others: one is that it has a quite impartial/unbiased perspective on how empires throughout history have operated, and the other is that the authors would actually compare the differences between empires in similar timelines. Another thing is that they include how empires have had to deal with their conquered subjects without risk to the ruling power. In addition, this book explains in great detail about how both the strengths and weaknesses of various empires contributed to their peak and decline. My favorite part of the book would probably be how in the fall of the Western Roman Empire entirely new empires have had to somehow find ways to set religion,like Islam and Christianity, as foundations for their legitimacy.

Overall, I would give this book a rating of 9.5/10. It's basically sorta does go into human history starting from the Roman Empire, so I'd say it's like a better , more detailed and less biased version of Noah's Homo Sapiens, except it doesnt go into prehistory that much.

Accordingly I believed this to be the case until now, I've recently read Ian Mortimer's biography of Edward III, ""The Perfect King"". In which he discusses, in detail, and states with certainty that Edward II was in fact not murdered, but kept alive. Was ""definitely"" alive in 1330, and in all probability lived in Italy as a hermit under the careful watch of the Pope and agents of Edward III, probably until about 1341.

What surprises me here is that Mortimer's book predates Jones' book by about 6 years. Given that Jones' book is a much higher level book (in terms of detail), covering hundreds of years in just 600 pages, it is to be expected that he might not cover every angle, but to not even mention the idea he might have survived 1327 strikes me as odd.

During the time of their rule, were Han Chinese ever critical of them due to the fact that they were considered to be foreign and not ""real"" Chinese? Both dynasties were oppressive and there were many uprisings against them, then again, the Han-ruled dynasties more or less had the same problems. I do know that there were rebellions against the Qing grounded in Han ethno-nationalism, but those were late in the dynasty's existence after European ideas of nationalism and national identity had reached China. Was there any criticism of the Qing prior to the 19th century that was based in the idea that because they were not Han, they were not truly Chinese? Was the Yuan Dynasty criticized during its reign for roughly the same reasons?

741,"Historians and history students of reddit, which historical fiction novels have you read that are historically accurate, or at least authentic?",13,uc45um,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/uc45um/historians_and_history_students_of_reddit_which/,33,"I'm trying to find a series of historical fiction novels to get into and, honestly, as a history student myself who places high importance on historical accuracy in media, I have a hard time trying to find a series - or even a stand alone novel - that properly portrays the time period when trying to tell its story.

For example, I read a sample of Conn Iggulden's *The Gates of Rome*, and I could not help but groan when Pompey Magnus, when declaring Caesar an enemy of Rome, referred to Rome's holdings as ""our country."" Plus, as is also the case with his *Hundred Years War* series, his contemporary prose takes you out of the experience, and does not feel like you are witnessing a story taking place in a different time period.

But enough of my rant. Overall, I'm looking for a series that not only has a good plot, but stays true to the time period it is representing. Although I prefer military and political history, I'm open to any time period.

Be it due to wars, tragedy, or the deterioration of texts, it's unfortunate but it's true. We've gotten very good at putting the puzzle together from the remaining pieces, but it's a puzzle nonetheless.


How could we, in modern times, best go about recording our own knowledge? Of course, the internet is a simple answer, but the internet is not permanent. Vaults exist, like the seed vault, that could be used to house texts-- in addition to things such as the library of congress, etc.


What can the everyday person do to write about modern life and ensure as best as possible that those writings will live to hopefully one day be rediscovered in the future, in the event of global catastrophe?


As a side note, I'm not implying that I think ""the end is nigh"" or anything along those lines. I just want to make sure that no information is lost over time. It never hurts to prepare, I suppose. For instance, if a modern burning of Alexandria were to occur-- the internet, some way or another, is lost-- or perhaps some catastrophe or circumstance that would cause a deterioration of physical texts were to occur, what can we do to maintain access to all of the information we have now? All of the history, culture, scientific development-- it's heartbreaking to think of all the information lost over time, and more so to think of all the information that WILL be lost over time.",1650818031.0,2022-04-24 16:33:51+00:00

They were excellent for pest-control, and also served as the symbol for their cat goddess, Bastet. The Ancient Egyptians valued all life, extending beyond just human life to animals as well. So the punishment for killing a cat would be death, and I've read in various places that even striking an image of a cat or Bastet could also be punishable by death (not sure if that is accurate).

So I know what the societal/criminal repercussions were for harming a cat, but what did the Egyptians believe would happen to the soul of a person who committed such an act? Did they fear the eternal damnation of their soul, perhaps in a ""hell"" equivalent for harming a cat?

# Preface from the translator

This is a translation of an extract from the book called “The Defense of the Fortress

Osovets”. The book describes the second attack on the fortress Osovets by the German troops

in WW1. The second attack started in January 1915 and lasted for 6.5 months where the first 6

months and some days were devoted to mutual cannon fire. The first 40 pages or so of the book

describe the terrain, the available weapons and the cannon fire in minute detail. I skipped those

pages and translated only the part that is about the famous poison gas attack made by the

Germans against the defenders of the fortress Osovets.

The authors of the book, officers Sveshnikov and Bunyakovsky, were in the fortress Osovets

at the time and took part in the described events. The book was published in 1917 before the

Russian revolution. Due to that fact, the authors are using the old-timey pre-revolution Russian

which differs in several ways from the modern Russian instilled by the Communist party after

1917 and possesses a sort of special lilting, long-winded charm which I tried to preserve (not

sure how successful I was). I also preserved the italicization of the original text.

The book was written with the intention of being used by military historians interested in this

period and as such it is not nearly as dramatic in the description of the gas attack as later

retellings; in fact, it was only called “the attack of the dead men” much later for the purposes of

amping up the drama. It is, however, the most accurate and detailed (and, to my knowledge,

more or less the only one) witness account that has survived over the century that has passed

since. The book in its physical form is only available in one or two of the biggest libraries in

Russia, most copies having been lost or destroyed, and fans of military history are sharing it

with each other as a pdf in their blogs.

Also, the book contains a large number of illustrations, such as military maps and weapon

schematics. I translated one such map covering the general area around Osovets in Photoshop

for you to have a clearer picture of what is going on and where everything is happening.

Hope you enjoy this text. Happy birthday!

The Gas Attack of July 24 th

On the 24 th of July our troops at the Sosnenskaya theatre of operations (TO) were situated as

follows:

The right flank of the Sosnenskaya TO by the village of Belogrondy was occupied by three

squadrons (the 1 st squadron of the Zemlyansky regiment and 2 squadrons of militia men). Their

task was to cover the first – the main – area of the Sosnenkaya TO from the right and cover the

Zarechny fort from the north side using the second road leading to the Zarechny fort via the

Budnensky bridge.

The centre of the Sosnenskaya TO and the left flank between the Rudsky channel and the

Sosnya village were occupied by 1.5 battalions (including 1 battalion of the Zemlyansky

regiment and 2 squadrons of militia men), situated in the following manner:

The first area of the Sosnenskaya TO along the railroad, as well as the Leonovo community,

was occupied by one squadron (number 10); they had a partial support from half a squadron of

militia men. These troops covered a most important way along the railroad and the Rudsky

channel towards the Zarechny fort.

The second area was occupied by one squadron (number 9) which was also supported by

half a squadron of militia men.

The third and fourth areas were also occupied by one squadron each (the 12 th and 11 th

squadrons of the Zemlyansky regiment).

One squadron of militia men was situated by the forest ranger’s house, in reserve of the

Sosnenskaya TO.

In view of this, the whole of the Sosnenskaya TO up to the village of Belogrondy was

occupied only by nine squadrons (three of them consisting of militia men). In order to strengthen

the reserves of the Sosnenskaya TO, same as every day during this period of defence, one

more battalion of the Zemlyansky regiment was sent from the Zarechny fort on the night from

the 23 rd to the 24 th , however, just before dawn, around 3 AM, this battalion returned to the

Zarechny fort as usual to rest after their night watch. Due to the small numbers of the garrison, it

was not possible to leave a lot of troops at the Sosnenskaya TO.

Against our 1.5 battalions the Germans brought about 12 battalions of the 11 th Landwehr

division and besides that, according to the accounts of captives, about 6 battalions were kept in

reserve.

Against the village of Belogrondy the Germans sent the 5 th Landwehr regiment together with

the 41 st ersatz-reserve battalion. Their task, it seems, was to break through our defence in

Belogrondy and furthermore to take over the Zarechny fort from the north side.

Against the first and second areas the Germans sent the 18 th Landwehr regiment together

with the 147 th ersatz-reserve battalion whose mission was to break through the center of the

Sosnenskaya TO cutting off the left flank troops and making them retreat to the marshes, as

well as attacking the Zarechnaya TO via the Rudsky bridge.

The 76 th Landwehr regiment was tasked with taking over the village of Sosnya and then

advancing towards the forest ranger’s house in order to act against the left flank troops of the

Sosnenskaya TO. These infantry troops were strengthened by the 1 st combat engineer battalion

and parts of the 36 th combat engineer battalion.

The 75 th Landwehr regiment was advancing along the railroad staying in reserve. Apart from

the 14 battalions listed above, according to the words of captives 2 more regiments (numbers

unknown) were also in the reserve of the attackers.

During recent preparations for an attack, over 30 gas batteries (several thousands of gas

cylinders) were delivered and installed in 4 places in front of the enemy trenches, 6-7 batteries

per installment. According to the captives, the batteries had been stealthily installed

approximately 13 days before the attack and during this period of time the enemy was waiting

for the most convenient atmospheric conditions in order for the poison gas to be at its most

devastating.

The Release of the Gas and Its Impact

At 4 AM on the 24 th of July the gas was released. It was of a dark green colour. The exact

recipe of it, having chlorine in its base, was hard to determine, however, there was undoubtedly

some other addition that intensified the choking effect.

The dense cloud of gas reached our trenches after only 5-10 minutes. It was heading

towards the fortress fast, having a high starting speed and expanding to the sides (its initial size

was no more than 2 versts \[a verst = 1.0668 kilometres\]) and up.

The impact of the gas cloud was such that, on the one hand, it created a cover hiding the

movements of the enemy, and on the other hand, it brought lethal poisoning to everything it

touched. The first victims of the poisoned fumes were scout parties and secret sentries who all

died. Despite the measures taken, such as burning tow and hay in front of the trenches, pouring

and spraying of lime white and wearing respirators, almost all defenders of the 1 st , the 2 nd , the

4 th and half of the 3 rd area of the Sosnenskaya TO were poisoned by the choking gas to death.

Half of the people in the reserve of the Sosnenskaya TO were also poisoned. The expansion

of the gas forward measured almost 20 versts, with the height of the cloud being 5-6 sazhen \[a

sazhen = 2.1336 m\], but the devastating impact of the gas was notable up to 12 versts after

which its influence weakened greatly.

Along with the lethal assault on our front troops, the poison of the gas also overwhelmed the

majority of the defenders of the fortress, getting into even tightly closed rooms. All flora over

more than 12 versts was burned by the gas.

The garrison took all of the recommended measures against the gas but it turned out that the

anti-gas masks available at the time only helped against the gas very little due to the small size

of their neutralizing area and possibly due to the fact that using them in combat was incredibly

difficult as it was hard to tie them on and keep them fitted tight to the skin; it was especially a

challenge for the officers who, while commanding the soldiers, had to take the masks off or lift

them up temporarily. The strength of the gas was partly diminished by the conditions of the

climate and local geography: the morning of the 24 th was cold, foggy and damp, and after

having passed over the wet marshes, the river and the moats the gas was considerably

weakened which saved the garrison from enormous losses.

The actions of the attacking parties

After the release of the gas, the enemy instantly sent up red flares everywhere, signaling that

the gas had been released and the movement of the troops for frontal assault could now begin.

After the flares all German batteries opened heavy fire equally at all areas of the

Sosnenskaya TO, especially at the village of Osovets seeing as the Germans were afraid of us

attacking the advancing enemy flanks from there; the fire also covered the only road leading

from the reserve of the Sosnenskaya TO via the Rudsky channel to the Zarechny fort which was

the only place capable of sending reinforcements to Sosnya, and lastly they fired at the

Zarechny fort, the Zarechnaya TO, the other forts and the base area, and meanwhile the

artillery shells were also filled with a concoction that, at the explosion of the shells, created

clouds of choking gas.

Under the cover of the artillery fire and choking gas the infantry started their assault.

The attackers’ plan was of two parts: the first one – sending scouts ahead to investigate the

impact of the gas on the defenders of the trenches, and the second one – storming the TO.

The scouts were assigned, numbering 200 people from each regiment, and the main

attacking forces moved in two lines, keeping their ranks closed and having the reserves behind

them.

At first the Germans attacked the first area of the Sosnenskaya TO which they were the

closest to before July 24 th ; besides, a frontal attack may have been more difficult for the

Germans but in case of success they would have cut off the centre and the left flank of the

Sosnenskaya TO while pushing the troops occupying those areas out into the marshes and

separating the Sosnenskaya and Belogrondskaya TOs.

By this time in the first area only two soldiers with machine guns were left alive. They wanted

to open fire at the advancing Germans but were so weakened by the gas that they were not

able to do it; then they dismantled the machine guns and buried the parts right there in the sand

nearby and they themselves died right there, in the machine-gun nest.

Having quickly cut about 10 passages through the three lines of wire fences in front of the

first area, the Germans flooded the area and went further on both sides of the railroad. The

extremely heavy fire opened at that moment by our artillery made most of the Germans scatter

and only some parts of the 18 th Landwehr regiment broke through and reached the trenches of

the reserves of the Sosnenskaya TO.

Continuing the frontal assault, they managed to reach the second area where the majority of

defenders had also succumbed to the gas. From there a part of their forces made their way to

the flank of the third area and another part continued advancing towards the reserves.

At the same time the 76 th Landwehr regiment, having gathered in the forest to the west and

south-west of the village of Sosnya and having lost approximately a thousand of their people to

their own gas which had crept towards the west as they approached the fortress, attacked the

village of Sosnya where very few remained alive by then. After crushing the skulls of 36 dead

men , a part of the enemy forces moved from there towards the flank and the rear of the third

area. In the meantime one of the fortress machine gunners took his machine gun with him,

moved away from the village of Sosnya and, having situated himself between the village of

Sosnya and the third area, began shooting the Germans surrounding him at point-blank range.

He managed to spend 2 ammunition belts but when he was inserting the third one into the gun,

the Germans used the break, attacked him and tore him to pieces; only his forehead was left

intact.

After that the Germans moved to the third area, surrounded it and attacked it from three

sides but could not take it because the defenders continued to fight them off stubbornly with rifle

and machine gun fire.

At that time the Germans who had been advancing from the first and the second areas

reached the trenches of the reserve and started climbing the wire fences. Their advancement

had cut off Belogrondy as they had passed the spot with the only bridge connecting the

Belogrondskaya TO with the Sosnenskaya one and the rest of the fortress.

Due to the fact that the wire net only covered half the distance between the railroad and the

Rudsky channel, some separate German parties started going around in order to attack the

reserve from behind as they could not succeed from the front.

As a result, out of the whole front of the Sosnenskaya TO we only had the third area left with

us; it separated the Germans operating to the left and to the right of it. The Germans advancing

along the railroad were in a hurry to increase their success and separated into several lines

which followed one another and couldn’t support each other in case we counterattacked.

The leading troops attacked the position of the reserve while the last troops were still near

the Leonovo community which they were adapting for their own defence.

The leader of the Sosnenskaya TO captain Potapov, seeing the critical situation his people

were in, ordered the militia men squadron that was in reserve to move forward and take over the

rear trenches on the hill. Thanks to this order the enemy was stalled; in the meantime the

captain asked for reinforcements from the head of the 2 nd defense department.

At the time when at the Sosnenskaya TO the enemy, meeting almost no resistance from the

poisoned defenders of the 1 st , 2 nd and 4 th areas of the Sosnenskaya TO, took those areas and

closed in on the reserve, at the Belogrondskaya TO the Germans, counting about 2 squadrons,

followed the gas and attacked the village of Belogrondy from north-west where by that time the

area of approximately 2 versts only contained about 20 survivors with 2 machine guns one of

which was operated by the warrant officer Retyunsky of the Zemlyansky regiment and the other

one by a machine gunner of the fortress artillery force. The Germans managed to cut down one

row of the wire fence pickets within 50 seconds but were driven away by the machine gun fire.

After that they regrouped twice for an attack but were scattered by the machine gun and

artillery fire, and also their further advancement in the section between the villages of Osovets

and Belogrondy was likely partially stalled by the appearance in their flank and rear of the

scouts of the Livensky regiment that had been sent from the Budnenskaya TO to find out the

situation at the Sosnenskaya TO.

Due to this critical situation which the garrison of the Sosnenskaya TO was in, and also

realizing that the current state of affairs was a direct threat to the Zarechny fort and the

Zarechnaya TO–as the Germans only had to defeat the reserve before storming the

fortress–the fortress artillery was ordered to create a curtain of fire in front of the Sosnenskaya

TO and the head of the 2 nd defense department, colonel Kataev, was ordered to counterattack

with the available units of the Zemlyansky regiment.

The fortress artillerists, poisoned by the gas, could not start firing right away which was why

the point units and the first line of the enemy got through the front of the Sosnenskaya TO and

stabbed the remaining defenders, seizing the anti-assault weapons and machine guns, but the

curtain of fire from the fortress artillery forces cut the enemy’s reserves from the first line,

stopped their assault and drove them back with big losses.

The head of the 2 nd defense department ordered the 13 th squadron to move from the

Zarechny fort to the Sosnenskaya TO, halt the Germans’ advancement towards the fortress at

any cost and gain back the lost 1 st area of the Sosnenskaya TO. The 14 th and the 8 th squadrons

were sent after them with the following orders: firstly to take back the village of Sosnya and

secondly to take back the 2 nd area of the Sosnenskaya TO.

The 13 th squadron which was the garrison of the Zarechny fort had already lost 20 men to

poison gas; the commander of the squadron sub-lieutenant Kotlinsky was also poisoned but

remained in the ranks. Combat-engineer officer sub-lieutenant Strzheminsky volunteered to be

deployed with this squadron in order to ascertain during the fight what fortification constructions

would be necessary within the Sosnenskaya TO.

The squadron, already strongly poisoned by the choking gas, crossed the bridge and the

one-verst-long log way under heavy artillery fire from the enemy, formed a line and started an

attack along the railway.

Having stepped out onto the reserve echelon line, sub-lieutenant Kotlinsky personally

conducted reconnaissance and, assessing the situation correctly, led his squadron into a swift

attack from 500 paces toward the advancing German lines. The Germans opened heavy rifle

and machine gun fire at the 13 th squadron and it didn’t stop the charge despite the fact the

sub-lieutenant Kotlinsky was at this moment lethally wounded and gave the command of the

squadron to combat-engineer officer sub-lieutenant Strzheminsky. The latter unsheathed his

sword and with a yell of “Hurrah!” charged at the Germans, leading the squadron. The terrain of

the attack was difficult: the ruins of old blindages were holes in the ground which people fell in;

planks and logs stuck out everywhere, etc., but the brave squadron, truly worthy of their late

commander, finished their swift attack and, using their bayonets, forced the Germans to

abandon their positions and then also the front trenches of the 1 st and 2 nd areas of the

Sosnenskaya TO; in the meanwhile 14 prisoners were captured. Our anti-assault weapons and

machine guns that were in the trenches and had been previously taken by the Germans were

won back from the enemy in good condition. Sub-lieutenant Strzheminsky was suffering from

acute poisoning from the choking gas but remained in the ranks.

After retaking the 1 st and 2 nd areas of the Sosnenskaya TO and finding out that the village of

Belogrondy was now ours, the attack at the Leonovo community began.

The terrain made the attack difficult. Our own wide wire fences were blocking the way.

Attacking was only possible along the line of communication whose length was fired at by the

Germans from the trench between the 2 nearest wire fences. We had to employ the French

method of trench warfare with hand grenades and move forward using gun shields.

The fortress artillery focused their fire on the Leonovo community and their efforts went

beyond all expectations. The square plot of land, 50 paces in size, was bombarded from 9

heavy batteries and 2 light ones, and also our troops opened fire at the enemy’s rear from the

Belogrondskaya TO and the first area. As a result, the Germans were mostly killed, with only a

few of them having had time to retreat, and there was even no need to attack with bayonets,

and that was how by 10 AM we had taken over the last and most important bastion of the

Germans.

At the time when at the first area there was fighting to retake the first area and the second

one, as well the Leonovo community, and when the gas started to disperse, the head of the 3 rd

area, the commander of the 12 th squadron sub-lieutenant Cheglokov, having found out that the

Germans were separated into 2 forces by his area and that one of those forces had taken over

the village of Sosnya and was determined to overwhelm the 3 rd area from the flank and the rear,

immediately moved a platoon to the flank and opened heavy rifle and machine gun fire at the

Germans in order to prevent their takeover.

Despite attacking fiercely, the Germans were defeated twice and had to retreat to the village

of Sosnya where, hiding in the folds of the terrains and in the tall rye, they continued to shoot.

At this moment the 14 th squadron which had been sent to support the left flank of the

Sosnenskaya TO arrived. Sub-lieutenant Cheglokov together with his people and half the 14 th

squadron assumed the offensive energetically and, despite the Germans’ strong resistance, he

personally led the troops into a bayonet attack which forced the Germans out of the trenches of

the village of Sosnya (the 4 th area) which he completely took over, returning our previously

captured cannons and machine guns and also taking 14 prisoners.

The 8 th squadron which had been sent out after the 14 th squadron reinforced the second area

of the Sosnenskaya TO and helped to keep it.

In this way, by 11 AM, that is, after 7 hours, the famous gas attack was finished and it was

brilliantly and selflessly resisted by parts of the glorious Zemlyansky regiment.

All direct commanders of the fortress, officers and soldiers of the Zemlyansky regiment and

the fortress artillery forces, poisoned by the gas in their majority, displayed heroism,

selflessness and resourcefulness. The tiniest delay in sending the squadron out for a

counterattack, any tardiness in firing by the fortress artillery – they could all have led not only to

losing the Sosnenskaya TO but also to the Germans taking over the Zarechnaya TO and the

Zarechny fort the loss of which to the enemy would inevitably result in the fall of the fortress.

The captured Germans taken during the gas attack said that every attacker from the highest

commanders to the last private of the German division had been certain that this time the

garrison could not be saved, that nothing could withstand the power of the gaseous poison. The

certainty that the whole garrison would perish from the gas had been so great that the Germans

had assigned several squadrons in advance for burying the dead, and all carts had been

prepared and ready to enter Osovets. For that reason the first shot and then the increasing fire

from the fortress artillery was extremely astonishing and therefore it was possible to understand

all the atrocities that the conniving enemy carried out against the honoured heroes who died for

the precious stronghold.

The enemy’s new unsuccessful attempt to take the fortress via a gas attack did not

discourage further efforts and, while continuing their blanketing fire, they, according to the words

of the Polish soldiers who had defected to the fortress, started to prepare the second, an even

more lethal gas attack; but this second attack was late thanks to the fortress evacuation that

followed.

All in all, this gas attack was the end of the military operations by the fortress. Although the

Germans continued firing at the fortress, it was no longer as intense as previously. During this

period of firing, scout parties from both sides went out to explore and some skirmishes occurred

between small squads.

On the 4 th of August the fourth and the last period of the siege and defense of the fortress

was over.

Ancient history is full of this, wars of aggression between major powers which were victorious for the aggressor. It seems to me that aggressive wars were much more successful in the past. When I think of Rome, the Mongols, the Huns, Alexander. It seemed that wars of aggression built empires in the past and there wasn't that united front which seems to stop this for a few hundred years now.

But as I thought about it more, the less sense it seemed to make. I imagine it would be a comfortable way to carry a sword, it wouldn't get in the way of much, but the unsheathing process would be quite difficult.

To unsheathe the sword, you'd have to reach over your back, grab the handle, and pull it straight up until it was out of the sheathe so you can use it. But for most sword lengths, as you pull it straight up and out, your arm would be fully extended before you'd be able to get the sword all the way out of the sheath.

Of course this depends on the length of the sword, arm length of the individual, etc. But I imagine it'd be a difficult process regardless. So I was wondering if this is just something we see in media because it looks cool or if there is historical precedent for this method of sword carrying? Perhaps the sheathes you'd wear across your back would be designed differently from traditional sheathes?",1650219080.0,2022-04-17 18:11:20+00:00

Dying, he gave to the Australian soldier a letter (and possibly some personal items) to send to the German soldier's family.

Edit: I wrote a paper on how the Senkaku Islands are Japanese territory since the 19th century considering the Japanese claims of terra nulius, because when they first approach those islands around the first Sino-Japanese War, they noticed those lands had not markings on them and after a few reconnaissance trips to those islands and China not laying formal claims for that territory Japan absorbed those 9 islands to their territories.

773,1553 CE: The succession options for Edward VI were all women: his two sisters and Lady Jane Grey. But England had never had a queen regnant.

775,Shield wall: A non Sword Formation?!,10,u2xvkw,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/u2xvkw/shield_wall_a_non_sword_formation/,33,"My personal conclusion

The shield wall, a dense formation of overlapping shields, appears in Movies and games and reenactment, However there seems to be the widespread idea that the shield wall is a formation of swordsmen even in reenactment.  However every historical depiction i have seen shows spears.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM-afOXLBdM&t=427s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM-afOXLBdM&t=427s) 

Every swordsmen would have been a Spearman, with the term swords men not even existing in ancient greek. The only exception to this is the roman legionary, who didnt fight in a shield wall.

*""Now, a Roman  soldier in full armour also requires a space of three square feet. But  as their method of fighting admits of individual motion for each  man—because he defends his body with a shield, which he moves about to  any point from which a blow is coming, and because he uses his sword  both for cutting and stabbing,—it is evident that each man must have a  clear space, and an interval of at least three feet both on flank and  rear, if he is to do his duty with any effect.""*

As one roman would meet to greeks, a greek just takes 1.5 which is pretty much shoulder to shoulder it fits the description of a (really) dense formation.

The greeks at least would place their elbow over the shields, it therefore would be impossible to raise the shield to block a strike from above like from a sword. This would also explain why shock weapons, like the dane ax or the falx are striking from above, and are so effective. The roman fighting moves, use a lot of raising the shield which matches with the quote.  What is interesting is that the romans stole thier weapon designs from the Gauls, who use oval, and other tower  shields, with some rectangular however being relatively narrow. SO the roman descriptions of gauls fighting in a loose fashsion, individually, mid just mean that they fought similar to the romans, the narrow shields could allow to use the individual while still fighting relatively close together, They seem to small for overlap. When Cesar came they allready adopted a phalanx formation.

Back to the topic, the shield wall seems to be the best formation for fighting a cohesive unit as a team, a tactic where the individual skill and movement is suppressed for the good of the whole. A Sword on the other hand seems to be the symbol of the individual fighter, the hero, the king, the champion, the raider.

The question is, can you keep up a shield wall in sword distance, and should you?

When watching those reenactment battles or sca,  what i noticed is that people tend to raise their shields to stop the the enemy from striking over it. so both sides stike somewhat blindly over each others shield once they go shield to shield.  The shield wall really seems to work and hold when at spear point, which happened much more at sca (watched mainly Bridge battles, as they arent as chaotic) where spears and other pole arms are used as much if not more than shields. Sooner or later the shields would charge and often go shield to shield and engage in the above or even push into or back the formation. Its pretty brutal. pole arms are also surprisingly effective in this mess, being even (sometimes) able to hold thier ground and fight as their shield wall collapses into chaos.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGR4dgeStOQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGR4dgeStOQ)

&#x200B;

The sword is an individual weapon, why would you even what to fight with in in a formation when you cant really support each other with it.

in a shield wall it also seems hard to block strikes from above, like from a sword,

whis would aso explain why shock weapons, like the dane ax or the falx are striking from above, and are so effective.

The wedge formation makes also seense, as it is not a shield wall, (seems hard to impossible to maintain a dense formation with overlapping shields, tho a dense formation would be needed if you want to shove throu the enemy). The point of the wedge mind not be to push in or thru the formation, (could be and depends on angle, mass ecra) but you close in.

Putting the boldest, best and most armoured, the leaders in the front, they take the brunt of the defence. The defender spear men mid all aim for the one in the front allowing and forcing the other to close in. Another posibility could be that large parts could reamain outside the spear range.

But that are just idears. 

Let me know what you think or what you know/ have expirienced. I want to see other view point and opinions than mine on this. This is pretty theoretical and logical, so dont just quote some historian or try to interpret some other question into this. think and theorise about it, you mid just come up with a new posibility. Oh if you have any historical acount that fit the topic feel free to share them. Just be civil.

Over time, Franklin’s wager was misused, neglected, and contested—but never wholly extinguished. Franklin’s inspiring stake in the “leather-apron” class remains in play to this day.

Since even if they did produce more grain there would be little profit,the peasants/Serfs stay with three field subsistence farming and the landowners didn't care much,This situation persist even after the abolition of Serfdom in 1861 but would slowly change since the Russian Imperial government started expanding railroad after the Crimean war and by 1890s Russia became the World largest exporter of grain.

I am reading the book ""The American Slave Coast: A History of the Slave-Breeding Industry"" and I came across something puzzling.

In the book, it is stated that the American enslaved produced almost everything needed for running of the plantations, the wood to build buildings and docks, the bricks for the mansion, tools, etc. They even did iron working, with two exceptions: They didn't produce chain - this makes sense to me - and they didn't produce hoes. 

So I can't figure out why they wouldn't produce their own hoes; is it the sharp metal edge? But why then the specificity and not just ""sharp objects that could be used as weapons""; if they made shovels and axes, why not hoes? Am I missing an obvious answer? It was mentioned that they did USE the 'bows' for the farming instead of plows because it was harder work so they'd have less energy to try to escape or revolt.

France and England could not respond for instance because they were exhausted from the Hundred Years War.

Pope Nicholas does this both in the Papal Bulls Dum Diversas(1452) and Romanus Pontifex(1455).

There's a celebratory dinner after the battle is over and King Cnut has taking London. King Cnut spares Prince Edmund's life (to rule England alongside him we later find out) and also gets Eadric Streona to come on in for the party.

We end up with a round table including conquered Prince Edmund, traitor Eadric Streona of Mercia, Queen Emma of Normandy, King Cnut, and a bunch of other viking princes, lords, earls, etc. getting spoils and loot shared amongst his allies whilst also working out to do with Edmund, Eadric, and Queen Emma.

He beheads Eadric Streona in front of everyone because he can't be trusted.

Thanks for reading this far, I felt like needed to set the scene.

MY QUESTION: 

After battles were won/lost like this, was it ever realistic to have such a scene play out? Were rulers like Prince Edmund ever just allowed to live like that on a whim instead of just killed immediately?

It was really interesting and I’d like to take a guess as to what their purpose was. 

My hypothesis is that the dodecahedrons were used as dies for extrusion, specifically for arrow and ballista shafts. 

The holes on them all seem to go from one large size, progressively down to a small final size. Holes opposite one another are smaller, but seem to be reduce at a proportionate rate. If you take something malleable and force it through one hole it will come out the size of the hole opposite to it. 

I think to use it, an arrow maker would rest the dodecahedron between something solid using the knobs on the corner to brace it. You start with a small fresh cut branch of a tree that you want to turn into an arrow. Push it through the largest hole into the hole opposite it. Using a mallet to force the piece of wood through the hole you can quickly change the diameter of the piece your working on. 

Next, flip the object around and find the hole that your piece now fits into and push it through the hole opposite it, again using a mallet to force it the rest of the way. 

Repeat this process until you’ve gone through the smallest hole and you have created a usable arrow shaft in a shorter time than if you had carved it. 

The shape of the dodecahedron allows you to properly balance it no matter which face you’re using. You can get 6 operations with one tool, turning any piece of tree into a solid shaft in short order. With them being made of metal and not wood, you can put an edge on the die making the operation more efficient. Also metal would stand up to the abuse that a tool like a die goes through far longer than wood. The fact that they are hollow can help explain as well since if your tool gets clogged you have access to clear it out. 

The video said that most of the dodecahedrons but not all were discovered at military sites. If they are tools for extrusion this would make sense since extrusion isn’t used in very many industries outside of manufacturing. One thing you would need to have during a military operation is plenty of arrows. The tools could be used until they broke and then remade as necessary and because of this they wouldn’t all necessarily be uniform. 

The video talked about an icosahedron fashioned in similar design to the dodecahedrons that was discovered. I think that one could of been used to extrude pasta. An icosahedron would allow for 10 operations which would be necessary when handling something delicate like that. This could explain why they are found all over and not just at military sites. 

Feel free to share your thoughts and opinions on my hypothesis. Do you have any personal opinions as to the purpose of the dodecahedrons?",1648805673.0,2022-04-01 09:34:33+00:00

During travels, I imagine that knights going to war, in a decent number, would store their lances or spears in carts where they also stored armor, weapons etc (did they wore armor all the time of the travel, or just before the battle?)

Maybe long travels by land, like in the crusaded (yeah I know there were many, ones more by sea and other more by land etc).

I had this doubt because I'm writing a novel, about this knight travelling around with a squire-like guy. A long travel to a particular destination, along the path they have adventures etc, usual stuff lol.

For simplicity i decided the knight wear the armor all the time of the travel, and the sword on the side obviously, but the lance? They have no cart. All the time, is the knight who hold the spear (maybe somehow linked to the saddle), or the squire? And if it is the squire, makes more sense he hold it in the hands or attached somehow to the saddle?

I readen many explanations often telling the opposite thing.

Let's start by the main ""type"" (bad word I know, but is to give the idea) of armor.

The chainmail: the sources, but also what pop culture shows, are not univoque. A chainmail could protect from the cutting/thrusting of a sword, from an arrow, from a bolt (crossbow)?

The plate armour? On this, there seems to be more 'consensus', it protects from swords, not from lance, against arrow/bolts not clear.

And lamellar armor from the east, how were them?

I know there are other type of armor (leather for example, or ones made with wool etc), and many variations of them, but I would like to have a general idea about the protection they could give against different weapons.

Only thing that look sure is that both of this can't protect from blunt weapons and their effect on the body under the armor.",1648634182.0,2022-03-30 09:56:22+00:00

In history you see countless occasions of armies getting ambushed on march. How could that happen when your army has a scouting small cavalry units around your army? If you put 3 cavalry riders together as one unit and send about 90 (30 groups) around your army, wouldn't your army basically become immune to an ambush? Even if the enemy takes down some of them, others will notify the main force.

&#x200B;

There could be terrains hard to approach for cavalry, but then they could simply dismount to look for an ambush. They could shoot a whistling arrow to report an encounter with an enemy. (so that other scouts around them could hear it and notify the main army) Basically there seems to be so many ways to avoid unexpected ambush that I don't quite understand why so many armies in history allowed such ambushes. Moreover, if a general sees a terrain favorable for an ambush such as a forest and cliff, shouldn't they basically send scouts to see if there is an enemy army waiting? Even if his scouts are intercepted, that could at least hint at enemy presence near by.

How was real time battlefield reconnaissance operation before engagement conducted prior to the gunpowder era? How many scouts were grouped as one unit and sent out? How many units? Is there a reason why such unit size & unit numbers became a norm? I seem to recall in some battles generals sent couple hundreds of cavalry force as an advance vanguard with scouting duty instead of dispatching small sized units; again, why?

I majored in modern European history and watch a lot of historical channels on youtube thanks to my interest in the subject but I've not seen reconnaissance discussed in detail. I would love to know more about it.",1647926654.0,2022-03-22 05:24:14+00:00

I understand that The Battle of Waterloo is famous for being Napoleon’s final defeat, and it’s appeal as a fascination for those who want to dissect its tactics and details, but why is it so often included on lists of “Most Influential Battles in History”, or used as a pivot point for History. For instance you often see Jokes for an  alternative history where we are all speaking French had the battle gone the other way .  

In my understanding of the story of Napoleon, this was more of a last gasp or a tremendous gamble rather than a realistic situation where the former power of Napoleon’s empire could be restored. From my understanding hadn’t the ship pretty much sailed after his first defeat and exile? Had he won the battle wouldn’t it have still meant an almost inevitable defeat in the long run? At this point almost all of Europe had gotten their shit together, and turned on him , and would likely stop at nothing so see he never reached the same heights he once did. From my perspective the shattering of his army and reputation in Russia, was a way way way more important “what if”, than the battle of Waterloo, so it’s always bugged me that Waterloo is held in such high esteem in this regard.

Hallo everyone. That’s my first post on reddit so let me know if there is something I need to do differently. 

Recently I have gotten very interested in the time period from the end of the Cold War up to 9/11. From what I have read about it, this decade is often described as having been somewhat carefree and stable due to is placement in history between the two aforementioned historically significant events that changed the world in profound ways. Domestically the US economy was booming, foreign politics was out of tension after the fall of the Soviet Union and Pop Culture was flourishing with exciting new Movies and Music. I know that it wasn\`t really as carefree as often depicted, and a lot of it is probably due to nostalgia from the people how grew up during that time. And I am also aware that you can’t really fit history into convenient boxes like the 90s. Nevertheless, it’s a good way to think about history sometimes. 

Unfortunately, I haven’t really been able to find a good historical book on those topics. I am especially interested in the economic and political side of things, but I would also like to learn little bit more about the Culture in those times. Since Clinton was President almost throughout the whole decade, I also thought about reading a book on the Clinton years.

Most of the evidence is archeological/linguistic rather than being based on written sources -- given writing largely came with Christianity, means written accounts (Bede etc.) are unreliable. Even Roman accounts (Gallic wars etc.) appear slanted to Roman religion rather than other beliefs.

I'm focused interested in religion in England -- i.e., the lands that would be subject to Roman / Anglo-Saxon / Danish/Norse rule (i.e., Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria, Danelaw) and then latterly known as England from 927 AD.

As far as I can tell there was predominately:

1. pre-43 AD: Celtic religion
2. 43 AD - c. 410: Roman religion and Roman / Celtic hybrids, some Christianity
3. c. 410 - c. 600: Anglo-Saxon / Germanic religion, some Christianity
4. c. 600 onwards: Christianity

856,What are some capitalist countries that the USSR had decent relations with to counter the US during the cold war? The US had decent relations with explicitly communist states like the PRC or Yugoslavia as they were outside the Soviet bloc.

For many years India was technically socialist, if not communist, and sorta softly aligned with the USSR (which is why Russia and India have good relations today) but never formally committed and, like Yugoslavia, helped lead the non aligned movement. Both had if not terrific relations with the US, certain much better than Cuba or the USSR and avoided the embargoes and sanctions and military threats. 

I am not super well versed in Albanian history, but I think this could be true for Albania as well because it tended to align with Mao and the PRC more than the Soviets.

So it seems the US was willing to deal with or at least have open relations with communist but not Soviet bloc states. Is this true in reverse?

Did the USSR have decent relations with some capitalist countries that weren't in the US's sphere of influence? If so, which countries and why?

Edit:
Responses so far have been great!!!!! Tysm!!!!

Couple thoughts

1) I am aware Yugoslavia wasn't stalinist style communist. That doesn't mean it wasn't communist. There are a variety of flavors of communism and a great deal of thought. Gramsci =/= ho chi Minh =/= lenin =/= Tito.

It was a different kinda of communism. Very different and unique in the communist world.


2) France is a really good example I forgot about. The whole reason it is part of the UNSC is cause the Soviets wanted someone to counter the British and Americans

3) India wasn't initially capitalist. It technically still is a socialist country (though, like China, in name only)

4) China was communist under Mao. The sink Soviet split was largely ideological as Mao felt Kurschev was basically not communist enough. Market reforms and private property only became a thing under Deng Xiaoping in the 70s and 80s. China only joined the WTO in 2001 I think. 


5) relations between Yugoslavia and the ussr did improve, but Yugoslavia was never part of the soviets orbit. Same for Albania. This is a personal theory of mine, but I think the idea the cold war was about capitalism vs communism is wrong. To me, it was a geopolitical game. A continuation of the 19th century great game between the UK and Russia with the US replacing UK and nukes were involved so proxies were used. This would explain why the US had open relations with communist countries like Yugoslavia and the PRC but not say, East Germany. East Germany was part of the Soviet bloc. Post sink Soviet split prc and Yugoslavia were not. I was wondering if there were good examples of the reverse.

Hi! I´m new in this sub so sorry if I put up the wrong flair, or if I’m on the wrong sub for that matter. Ok, so I´ve seen a lot of debate surrounding this topic and I wanted to throw in my own input into the mix.

I was recently reading “The broken spears” by Miguel León-Portilla, I gotta say- a heartbreaking book, it truly moved me. It's a recollection of testimonies translated from nahuatl (the aztecs language) about the conquest, presenting their side of history and bringing to light the true extent to which indegenous culture was destroyed and all the things that were tragically lost. It got me thinking…what was the real cause of the fall of Tenochtitlan and all the things that followed? How could such a glorious culture let itself be taken down so easily?

No doubt we´ve all heard the tales of Spaniard superiority and how the white man's outstanding technology gave them an easy win, but I call BS on that. I think that it was most likely the clash of cultures and not the clash of weapons that broke them down. I mean, think about it- indegenous societies were much more stable and tranquil, they were unprepared for the aggressive, perverse demeanor and culture of the spaniards. It makes sense that that caused a state of anomie and individuals couldn't help but feeling futile; emotionally, psychologically empty and confused in the face of their previous morals and values disintegrating. 

I also think that indigenous people were too good for their own good. In various letters to the king from Cortes, as well as in the testimonies of several other people who accompanied him (Díaz and Gomara) it states that Moctezuma humiliated himself in front of Cortez by looking him in the eye (which was a forbidden thing to do for those who were not nobility) and kneeling submissively. Cortes and his army got a welcome so warm to the point they were almost treated like kings. All this was of course before they knew their true intentions but it still was a big contributing factor to their downfall, and even after their downfall most of these individuals did not fight back- much to the contrary, they licked their enemies boots. Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (a spaniard historian) describes them as good servants “God created them as simple people, who are free of evil \[...\] they are obedient, humble and serve their christian masters faithfully .”

And then of course there was the strategic killings of key power figures such as Moctezuma and Cuauhtemoc which were each described by Zamora  (a messenger to the king)  to “give birth to of a sort of chaos \[…\] a void of emptiness in which the universe disappears and pain is the only thing that remains.”, the people would suffer and feel aimless at the absence of a leader, which of course would make the conquerors job much easier.

Moreover, Fray Bernardino de Sahagún tells us in *The Florentine Codex* how the Spanish soldiers destroyed and burned down Huitzilopochtli's *cu mayor* (something like a church for their main god.) This action only confirmed the presages Aztecs had seen just a few days before the spanish arrival. I think this may contribute to the loss of trust between Aztecs and the colonizers and showed how their ""friends"" were.

After the Aztecs managed to put out the fire, they cried and cried, the fire was a bad presage, even more since it started in a sacred place.

I should say, this wasn't the only time the conquerors disrespected indigenous believes, we have so many examples i.e. Cholula and Templo Mayor's massacre, they even stole and kidnapped people from Tlatelolco market. These people weren't soldiers, they were merchants, artists, they were common people.

And of course there is more but that's the sum of it. Sorry for mistakes, english’s not my first language.

With medieval history I'm struggling a bit. I've read several overview type texts but am left with few memorable reference points and they're mostly pretty parochial as a brit (Alfred, Norman conquest etx). The first crusade and the black death might be the only wider ones. But otherwise if someone asks how 1000s/1100s/1200s/1300s differ I don't have much intuitive sense or reference point.

That means when I read something happened in 1183 the date doesn't really lock onto a reference point like it does with more ancient and more modern history (though for modern in all honesty I'm pretty vague on lots of 17th to 19th century too).

in 744 CE Morocco, during the caliphate of Hisham ibn abd al Malik, a self-professed Prophet of a new judeo-christian religion by the name of Salih Ibn Tarif starts to spread his new found religion in the region of Tamasna. According to Ibn Khaldun, Salih ibn tarif claimed to have received a new revelation from god, containing 80 chapters, from which some were named after famous prophets like Adam, and Noah. In his religion, his followers would fast the month of Rajab instead of Ramadan, they would pray 10 daily prayers instead of the required 5 (while not doing any prostration), and they would have no restrictions on the amount of spouses they could take, while Islam limited that number to 4. His grandson, Yunus ibn Ilias ibn Salih took over the torch and carried out this new religion forcefully, even killing an estimated 7000 people for not adhering to it.   


The Almoravids will fight them in 1059. Their spiritual leader Abdallah Ibn Yassine will die, but his companions end up winning, and they partly erase any trace of this ""blasphemous"" religion, until 100 years later where the Almohads finish the job.

It boggles me that after centuries of people eating like this and it working perfectly fine, they just decided to experiment for some reason.

Cereals remained the most important staple during the early Middle Ages. Barley, oats and rye were eaten by the poor. Standard foods included bread, porridge, and gruel. Fava beans and vegetables were important supplements to the cereal-based diet of the lower orders. Meat was expensive and prestigious. Game was common only on the tables of landowners. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken, and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted, they made their way far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.

Article:
https://jacobinmag.com/2022/02/price-controls-supply-chain-economic-policy-free-market-inflation

The argument is about price controls and it lays out a specific historical example, West Germany. I am not well versed in West German history, are there Germans here or those who are familiar with the history that can fact check the following quote?

""
The term “price controls” points to the market mechanism’s long history of dysfunctionality, which also partially explains why the debate makes so many economists nervous. The most important legitimate argument against price controls is that of prices’ “signaling function,” which is said to ensure an efficient distribution of resources over the medium term. That isn’t very helpful in a crisis, but nevertheless, I’ll propose a compromise: rather than control prices, why don’t we limit profits?

The history of the emergence of Germany’s social market economy proves surprisingly instructive in this regard. After World War II, West Germany was plagued by strict pricing rules, shortages, and rationing. The minister of economics at the time, Ludwig Erhard, planned to bring these conditions to an end via means of a “free market economy” and comprehensive price deregulations. With permission from the American occupiers, he took the first step in this direction with a currency reform launched on June 20, 1948.

But Erhard’s assumption that prices would soon “level off” proved to be erroneous. Instead, rapid price rises led to desperation and were soon followed by angry protests. A solution was promised in the form of the so-called “StEG Program”: surplus military gear was to be repurposed for civilian use on a mass scale and introduced onto the market. Nevertheless, prices stayed high and trade profits continued to rise.

The situation only changed with administrative measures that contradicted Erhard’s beliefs: on September 6, 1948, the authorities established legally binding “maximum prices for end consumers” and capped profit margins at 20 percent. Only after this combination of price controls and revenue caps did prices finally go down — including those of competing “free” goods. The successful program was wound down in 1953, and Ludwig Erhard — quite absurdly — became a symbol of successful economic policy.

Recently I found a song of Przemysław Gintrowski, Polish artist , called ""Kataryniarz"". I recognized most of historical references but I can't figure out this one:

My translation:
""And a ghastly waltz sounds as the world goes dancing
Ang once again to the windmills someone rushes on a horse
Once again Abel falls deas, the murderer- unknown
And he who fought for the people has his hands cut off""

Polish version in case I messed something up:
""I brzmi walc upiorny aż wiatr poszedł w tany
I znów ku wiatrakom ktoś pogna na koniu
Znów Abel padł martwy, morderca- nieznany
A kto za lud walczył, obcięte ma dłonie""

The first part is referencing Don Kichot of course, I wanted to quote the whole part to give context. It's probably referencing something that happened on Appanin Peninsula since the song also mentions Bastille, Florence and Rome, no other places.

I graduated high school last year online in december and all I remember is thinking ""THANK GOD! NO MORE BORING LECTURES!""  as well as other thoughts about just hating school. I feel like i've retained almost none of what I was taught in school and that sucks because some things they try to teach you in history is actually pretty cool, but its presented in a way that punishes you for not retaining it while some teachers present it with the enthusiasm of somebody that just wants to die while pretending to be enthusiastic, which makes for a nasty combo of forgetting the material, and that defeats the purpose of school.

Im sure some teachers really do love what they do, but the chances of getting a teacher like that as well as that teacher teaching their material in a way thats fun as well as informative are the same chances of getting a romantic partner or winning the lottery sometimes

When good stories in media references history, then the history involved with that story will usually stick out in your mind more because the pressure of needing to remember this for a test is gone and theres no uninterested teacher trying to present it with a Google Slides Presentation

Also, when good stories in media reference history, its usually relevant to the plot sometimes, which is why I said that history involved with good stories in media helps that part of history remain in your mind

Mamluks which actually means  ""one who is owned"" in arabic, were purchased as property but their status was above those of ordinary slaves, who were not allowed to carry any weapon. Over time, they became a powerful military knight class, especially in Egype and the Levant. They controlled these areas for 250 years  (1250–1517) and are known for several military feats: to quote a few: they effectively ended the era of the Crusades in the 12th century, they pushed back and eventually defeat the Mongol Ilkhanate at the battle of Ain Jalut.  


They eventually are defeated by the Ottomans in 1516 which essentially ended their era of domination over the muslim world.  


These facts raise several interesting questions: the first obvious question of slavery and its many different forms it took over the centuries.  I find it fascinating that a class of slave soldiers become rulers for so long a period while still representing the empire that enslaved them in the first place !  


The second question is a controversial one in the muslim world: how and why would the Ottomans, a muslim dynasty, attack another muslim dynasty ?

As we know Central Asia 2-3 thousands years ago looked closer to northern Europe than it does now. People spoke Indo-European languages. These Indo European people were warlike and migratory. They practically ended civilizations from Britain to the Indus Valley. In northern China, studies indicate that when Indo European people moved into region, agriculture practically disappeared.

But now central Asia and east asia are dominated by people speaking East Asian languages from the Altaic and Chinese language tree. The Turks especially were credited with defeating the indo European people of Central Asia going as far as Anatolia and defeating the strongest Indo European civilization of the time, the Byzantine Empire. The Huns who are believed to be Turkic speaking even managed to force most of the Indo European tribes of Eastern Europe under their control. Until the years of Russian expansion, eastern Europe was dominated by Altaic language speaking people like the Tartars and the Mongols.

As we know the earliest Turks were rice farmers from North East Asia. Rice farming made for a culture of collectivism as opposed to the individualist nomadic pastoralism of the Indo Europeans. These Turks then moved west and adopted nomadic culture and started over running the indo Europeans.

My understanding is that these Turkic people having had to deal with constant warfare with indo Europeans evolved cultural practices, traits and behaviours that made them uniquely suited to fighting them. One common hypothesis was that indo Europeans did not cooperate with each other and fought in relatively small warbands while the Turks coming from a collectivist society managed to get larger numbers of people to fight.

Would that explain why Turks were so successful against indo Europeans managing to get as almost into the heartland of Europe itself?

This is also not to say many don't do the same today, or at least try to put a different paint over it.

But I'm interested in learning more about the psychology behind why certain leaders did what they did? Why were they power hungry? Did they just think they were the best for the job?

Why did they constantly try to expand? Did the rewards that greatly outweigh the cost both in lives and resources? How much did they actually care? Were they trying to gain more land for their people or were they just looking for a shiny new toy?

Also why did they treat the inhabitants of conquered lands how they did? Once they were conquered did they consider them their people? Why or why not?

Were they just trying to build a legacy? Why was that so important to them?

You're talking ships that are long but not deep,

They weren't like ships of the 1700s or even like Greek Trieme,

You're talking about ships where you just sit in and row.

 There was no upper or lower deck. There was just a floor.

If you were lucky they had tables in some of them you could sit in, and maybe tents to sleep in, but they were essentially like rafts. 

And yet somehow, they managed to get to Iceland, England, France, Ireland, even America. 

They sailed across the ocean in a tiny flat little ship, knowing that they could be sailing for days, even months 

The world could've been flat and they could've fallen off the edge, or there could've been sea dragons or sea  monsters 

And they took this risk, 

Yet SOMEHOW they pressed on, determined to find new land. 

It's just mindblowing. 

To put everything on a gamble, European ships were destroyed by waves and storms but somehow Vikingr ships withstood it all. 

It just astounds me compared to other cultures how fearless the Norse were, 

How purely dominant and powerful.

They traveled the coast of Africa, ventured to Byzantium, Arabia..everywhere except Japan, Antartica, Oceania, China and South America (maybe others?) 


My point is, there was no other warrior culture on the planet as incredible as the Norse were, 

They weren't even 6'8 with bulging muscles and horn helmets, 

They (probably) weren't even covered in tattoos, (only 1 Arabic account mentions it and we aren't even sure if was akin to modern tattoos) 

But their presence and sheer tactics overwhelmed the Angles, Jutes and Saxons, impressed Basil II of Byzantium enough to become his personal guards, enslaved the Celts (who themselves were incredibly vicious warriors) and managed to even baffle historians of today. 

The whole of the dark and middle ages was in their grip, and their legacy (while heavily romanticized and commercialized at times) couldn't be any further from something truly awe inspiring.",1645337570.0,2022-02-20 06:12:50+00:00

You can find dozens of pages describing how titles worked in the 17th and 18th centuries, but virtually nothing on how titles worked in pre-renaissance (medieval) england, france, germany, and italy. With that in mind, here's what I want to know.

* When did the children of kings start being styled as ""Prince/Princess X""? One resource suggested that, prior to the Hannover succession, children of the kings of england would've simply been titled the Lord or Lady X.
* I understand that, during the renaissance, children of Sovereign Dukes & Princes in the Holy Roman Empire were been styled as Princes... but was this the case in the middle ages as well?
* Given that French vassals were virtually sovereign during most of the middle ages, would their children have been styled, or at least regarded, as a Prince or Princess (i.e. children of the Dukes or Counts of Burgundy, Aquitaine, Normandy, Anjou, Flanders, Champagne)
* I noticed that during the middle ages, a lot of english princes and princesses are styled as ""Firstname of Place"" (i.e. Mary of Woodstock, Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, Edward of Westminster""). Why was this; would this factor in to their official style? i.e., prior to her marriage, would Elizbabeth of Rhuddland be styled as ""Elizabeth, Lady of Rhuddlan""? I know that in france, sons & daughters were often titled ""Monsieur/Mademoiselle de <Place>"", with <Place> being a random holding of their fathers'... I wonder if this practice is related somehow?

Since whatever is new from modern times, has probably been well recorder and has a date including year, month and day, it's not the case for ancient things that are ambiguous.

Maybe there are out there models/standards on how to sort and organize dates with a mix of arab and roman numeric, depicting both precise dates, or periods in time. BC and AD.

Any ideas? Like, how would you tag them correctly?

Doing it on excel.

However, When I google this subject, the  only articles I can find are from websites selling pot, which I do not  trust for obvious reasons.  
These websites reference the book ""*Prehistoric Textile Art of Eastern United States* (1891)"" By William Henry Holmes, Which reads, ""*This fiber has been identified as that of the \_Cannabis sativa\_, or wild hemp.""*  
Besides  that, they also reference early explorers like Jacques Cartier who  mention hemp. I've looked at these, and provided my translation is  correct, they do indeed say hemp.  
These sites also refer to a  hopewell pipe dating to 400BC which they claim contains cbd residue. But  when I google this, nothing turns up except more pot sellers  referencing each other in a circle.  
My suspicion is that this is a  myth generated by the confusion surrounding the terms ""Apocynum  Cannabinum."" ""Cannabis Indica."" And ""Indian Hemp.""  
I suspect that  William Henry Holmes was mistaken, as there was no dna analysis back  then and one piece of 2300 year old string looks much like another.

I the Wikipedia page on clocks, I see three things mentioned:

1. ""grand clocks were symbols of status, grandeur and wealth""
2. Scheduling assemblies
3. Interest in astronomy, sometimes for religious or philosophical reasons

But there is not much detail and I don't see the compelling reason for scheduling meeting precisely during antiquity.  Maybe religious practice played a role.  But I am sure they could just signal with a bell or call to the surrounding area and roughly the right time without a clock.

Maybe clocks just became an indicator of being civilized and that was the main driving force.

Later, small portable clocks were very useful in ocean navigation.

Update:

With the help of various comments I have found:

Religious scheduling seems to be the most common application of early clocks dating back to 1600 BC.  And they were used in astronomy and astrology.  The earliest commercial application that I find was for sharing well water by allocating time-slots to farmers in India.

Clocks were used in Babylonia in astronomy and astrology.  I did not see any references to use in religious scheduling there.

But monks and astrologers tended to keep records that are less likely to be lost and not available as modern sources.  Maybe a lot was lost, not sure.

The earliest recorded marine use of an hourglass is 1345.  Systems of marine hourglasses were used to calculate the hours past apparent noon as one way to estimate longitude.

Why couldn't they, for example, use education and governance to make their overseas territories eventually assimilate and adopt a fully and completely British and French national identity and language? Why didn't they reorganize their overseas territories into normal provinces, give them representation, and eventually maybe produce prime ministers who were from their overseas territories?

For example, Siberia, for all intents and purposes, can be considered a Russian colony. It is honestly not very different from Canada, both are remote from the respective cores of the original country, yet modern day people from Siberia, no matter native or the descendants of Russian settles, all view themselves as Russian. The fact that it is connected by land across the Urals didn't make going from Moscow to Yakutsk any easier than from London to Canberra, at least not before railroads, yet those territories are very much Russian. Similarly, Alaska, Hawaii, and the entire American west coast can be considered American colonies, but were gradually integrated by the US with a combination of settlers and the locals adopting an American national identity.

At least, if Britain wasn't able to hold on to India or Africa, why wasn't it able to hold on to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand? These territories are not very culturally different from the British mainland, and it wouldn't require any work to make those people identify as ordinary British citizens, since most of them are descendants of British settlers. If Britain ever learned a thing or two from its loss of the United States and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, it could be that making people from those territories equal to the homeland politically might be able to preserve them, but that didn't happen, why? At least to me, it is baffling why Canada, Australia, and New Zealand didn't become just as integrally British as England, Wales, and Scotland. If Britain retained these territories, it would have a much stronger economy than it currently has and likely retain its position as a world superpower. Why would it give up on that? I don't really buy that it was bankrupt from the world wars theory, because wouldn't recovering from the war with more outlying territories not affected by the war and economic power be easier?",1644459209.0,2022-02-10 02:13:29+00:00

Obviously it sounds cool to say you adhere to an ""ancient"" code that follows principles of self control and honor. I understand why people would be drawn to the idea that there is some sort of timeless wisdom in warrior code. But was there an actual warrior code?

Were there rules passed down from generation to generation that samurai followed or did some historian just find a reference to it once and subsequently an entire lore was built around it because it sounds nice?",1644449088.0,2022-02-09 23:24:48+00:00

915,Were shields used by knights in early XVth cetnury?,11,soafeb,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/soafeb/were_shields_used_by_knights_in_early_xvth_cetnury/,10,"It is the fact that shield vanished from knight combat gear in circa 1400s, and the reason was, as we know - ""plate armor became too tough and shield were useless, etc"". But it is surely more complicated, right?

Now, my question is not about footman, crossbowman or tournaments. What i'm trying to understand  - is that were heater shields used by knights in real foot combat in circa 1400-1430?

I've done a little research myself and came to some interesting conclusions. For example, in some illustrations of the code of Wallerstein we can see fighters in plate armor using heater shields. Interesting thing is - they're use it either with and without spear, even for parrying sword:

[https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/File:Cod.I.6.4%C2%BA.2\_082v.jpg](https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/File:Cod.I.6.4%C2%BA.2_082v.jpg)

[https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/File:Cod.I.6.4%C2%BA.2\_091r.jpg](https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/File:Cod.I.6.4%C2%BA.2_091r.jpg)

[https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Codex\_Wallerstein\_(Cod.I.6.4%C2%BA.2)#/media/File:Cod.I.6.4%C2%BA.2\_104v.jpg](https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Codex_Wallerstein_(Cod.I.6.4%C2%BA.2)#/media/File:Cod.I.6.4%C2%BA.2_104v.jpg)

In some of illustrations shields are lying on the ground, as like knights somehow dropped them, but still, they were carrying it.

I understand that this manuscript is dedicated for fencing and tournament fight, but still, it could be kind of ""battlefield reflection"" in some points. Important detail about code of Wallerstein - is that we don't know exactly when it was written. Wiktenauer claims date range as circa 1420-1470. So it could be both early and late XV century. It's hard to tell something with that range.

Another example is in French Book of Hours ca 1425-1430. In the scene of crucifixion we can see a man in chainmail and brigandine, holding a large heater shield in his hand:

[http://ica.themorgan.org/manuscript/page/88/76786](http://ica.themorgan.org/manuscript/page/88/76786)

Another one - French ""Chroniques"" ca 1412-1415. There are almost no shields in this manuscript, but seems like they're still appear in the battlefield. In this particular illustration we can see a large round targe and possibly heater shield in the left. Both are hyperbolized in sizes, but they're still held by heavy armored footmen.

[http://ica.themorgan.org/manuscript/page/28/147009](http://ica.themorgan.org/manuscript/page/28/147009)

One more French example - ""Battle with dragons"" from Historia de proelis, ca 1420.

[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&IllID=50219](http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&IllID=50219)

English one - ""Battle of trees"" by Christine de Pisan, dated 1436. Might be not the real image, but there is still some sort of large, possibly metal shield used by foot knight with the sword

[https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&IllID=13334](https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&IllID=13334)

&#x200B;

So yes, this question is pretty hard. Of course, majority of manusripts of that time do not depict shields at all, but those images that were still depicting them causing even more questions because of it. My version is - shield usage depended on geographical place and economical wealth of knight. Perhaps, Milanese nobles threw out their shields even in XIV century, but plate armor of early 1400s still was not that perfect, and maybe some part of knights somewhere in England or Holy Roman Empire had not enough money to afford best gear possible, so still used shields in combat. Surely, they were not used widely, but the question is - was it possible to see a foot knight with shield in that years at all?

I have found some rumors saying that at that time in France, rich women would put on multiple layers of dress to show their wealth, while rich men would have more decorated buttons for the same reason. I'm wondering if that's the reason for all the buttons? And if that’s true, is this happening anywhere else besides France?

Another thing I have noticed is that the hussar jacket became popular during the 19th century, and it was originated with the hussar mercenaries of Hungary. I'm also wondering what makes the Europeans fall in love with this military outfit (if the reason does exist), and why would the Hungarians wear such things for the first time?

What is the earliest event in human history whose exact date is known beyond reasonable doubt? That is: **(1) the event is mentioned in a written source; (2) we can work out its Julian day and therefore exactly how many days ago it took place as of today; and (3) the fact is fairly certain**.

To take the obvious example, Julius Caesar was famously assassinated on 15 March, 44 BCE. As I understand it, there were several changes to the calendar system after that date. So can we calculate the event's Julian day with certainty? And how certain is it that the assassination even took place on that date? What about famous dates even earlier, for example from classical Greece? I'm already guessing astronomy is going to come up.

There are obviously a few variables here. But to be able to say with confidence exactly how many days ago an ancient event took place is surely a pretty big achievement in human civilization. It seems interesting to know how far back we can go.

In the republic and mid-empire most politicians had to have some form of military experience and prestige gained in war, Scipio, marius, ceasar and most emperors up to trajan had some form of military leadership that helped legitimize their powet and influence and Rome at the time had a very active hand in the tribes on their border not fearing to fight them or influence their politics. But as i was reading about the Eastern Roman Empire i see emperors who never led an army personally like Justinian and those emperors using theocratic structures to gain legitimized rule and they bribe the tribes to leave them alone and have a very defensive military structure and tactics. Why is that how did rome go from a militaristic offensive society to the settled borders and less militaristic Eastern Roman Empire.

Castle Pox: The Battle over Public Health in Marblehead, Massachusetts, 1773-74

Eva Blake Undergraduate Senior Thesis Department of History Columbia University 17 April 2020 

Seminar Advisor: Elisheva Carlebach 
Second Reader: Hannah Farber

A British led private hospital ran an inoculation treatment program for smallpox on Catta Island (now Children's Island), a part of Marblehead, Massachusetts. The Marblehead public was divided, poor vs gentry in social and financial strata. The poor Marblehead fishermen believed it was a plot by the British to kill off the population. This story unravels roughly 1 month after the Boston Tea party, anger was high over anything British. The gentry of Marblehead was in favor of the inoculation hospital, so this further cemented pre-existing issues.

Two Marblehead men went to Catta island (Children's island) and burned down the smallpox inoculation hospital. They came back to the mainland in Marblehead and bragged about doing it. The men were arrested and quartered in Salem for arson and attempted murder. A drunken mob of Marbleheaders, whipped up by the revolution, anti-British politics, and fear of smallpox, descended on Salem and broke the men out of jail. Salem roused the Salem militia and marched on Marblehead. Marblehead roused their militia and marched on Salem. They met on the town borders near Lafayette st and Forest River. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and they were able to resolve the situation without bloodshed. The two arsonists were returned to the Salem Sheriff.

From a Ruined Empire

a sample:


Oct 28, 1945

From: Sherry Moran in Tokyo

To: Mrs Frances Moran in Ohio


Dear Fritz,

  It is probably too soon after the war for people in America to realize what an amazing course the occupation has taken in its first eight weeks. Even I, who expected the Japanese to surprise us by their adaptability, who always thought it was a mistake to hold that the Germans were simply misguided human beings, susceptible of re-education, while the Japanese were animals to whom decent behavior could not be taught--even I find the Japanese reception of us heartening beyond all previous expectation. And I cannot help but wish that there were some adequate way to convey my feeling to you at home, to make you sense what it is like for us living and working among the Japanese.

I was going to tell you about the flood of letters which Japanese have been sending General MacArthur, who is now regarded by many as a savior, in approval of his policies. Some of the letters have been translated, and their general contents published in the *Nippon Times*; twenty-four letters in favor of prosecuting Japanese war criminals, sixteen in criticism of the Japanese government, and so forth. But a sample of this kind is not very convincing evidence of the Japanese state of mind. It has no statistical validity, unless one perhaps considered how unlikely it was that even this many letters were sent by Germans to their Allied masters. And it will not impress you with the genuineness and human appeal which the same sentiments convey when presented, as they are to us, in the context of personal relationships in the course of everyday life.

One day recently I had to visit someone who lived outside of Tokyo. When my party reached the town, we stopped to inquire the way at the local police station, and, as always seems to happen, we were furnished with a policeman for a guide. I had hoped this could be avoided, since the man we were calling on might be frightened when he saw us approaching with a police escort. It proved unavoidable, however; the policeman insisted on coming along for what I later learned was his first ride in a jeep. The ride was a bumpy one, of course, and conversation was difficult above the thump and rattle which marked our passage over each hole in the road. But the policeman kept looking at me as if he had something important to say, and when we ran into a short stretch of fairly smooth road, he finally came out with it.

""I am truly grateful to America for finally bringing us peace. Before, it seemed as if hardship and suffering would never end, and now suddenly it is gone.""

""Do you think that everyone looks at it the same way?"" I asked.

""Oh yes, almost everyone""

""How about the police?""

""I think that most of the police feel as I do. I realize that we have a reputation for oppressing the people and preventing criticism of the war, but what else could you expect the police to do in wartime?""

""Well, the bad reputation of the police did not start with the war. Their tyranny has been well-known for years.""

He was stopped for a few seconds, then remarked that he had not joined the police until a few years ago and could not speak about their earlier conduct. But he was sure that even the police were struck by the fine behavior of the American troops. ""They are"", he said, ""an inspiration to us; as representatives of democracy, they are winning many Japanese over to your way of doing things.""

""How long do you think we will have to stay in Japan to get the country started on the right road?""

""Sah...(the Japanese equivalent of ""You've got me there""). It is hard to say how long it might be. But I think you should stay until the job is done"".

I do not think the policeman told me these things just to please me. He was under no obligation to say anything more than ""Right"", ""Left"", or ""Straight ahead"", when we came to crossroads along the way. He may not, it is true, have been speaking for the majority of the police in Japan, but his sentiments must be those of many Japanese, for otherwise Americans would not find it so safe and pleasant as they do to travel around the countryside. These trips frequently take us far from the protection of any occupying force, and it would be an easy thing for hostile elements to do away with us, leaving no trace or clue to our disappearance. On dark nights I have traveled alone in a jeep, unarmed, in wild country far from an occupation outpost. A well-placed boulder in the road, at the end of a sharp curve, might have thrown the jeep and myself into a deep canyon, where the wreckage would not be found until the next day, too late to start a search for saboteurs.

Almost every day I meet people who speak as the policeman did. Only once so far have I run into a person whose feeling toward Americans did not quite fall into the common pattern. In our barracks building there was a girl named Aiko, who served in the mess upstairs. When our medical facilities were well enough equipped, it was decided to test the waitresses and kitchen help for venereal disease and tuberculosis. Aiko was declared tubercular and had to stop waiting on tables, but apparently she was not anxious to look for a job elsewhere. Her home was in Northern Japan and she had no desire to go back there; so, I learned on speaking to her in the hallway one day that an arrangement had been made for her to stay on doing maid's work while the medical people continued to treat her tuberculosis. 

""I never expected them to be so kind,"" she said, ""I hoped they would let me stay on, but it did not occur to me that I would also be given medical treatment. The kindness of Americans amazes me. Your arrival here has meant just the reverse of what we were told it would mean. It actually seems better that Japan did lose the war.""

A few days later I heard that Aiko was acting as an assistant to the Army doctor who treated the Japanese personnel working in the building. He had established a dispensary on our floor, and I began to notice that Aiko seemed to have a lot of spare time on her hands, for she would hang around the officers' quarters and occasionally offer to darn someone's socks. I also noticed that she gradually adopted the un-Japanese habits of chewing gum and smoking cigarettes, and that she attempted to enhance her natural attractiveness by an increasing use of make-up, which must, I thought, have been received from an American admirer. 

One night after supper I was standing in the hall, eating an apple and thinking about what I would say in a letter I was about to write to you. Aiko came down the hall and sat down at a desk near me. She seemed less gay than usual, avoided my gaze, and hardly answered my ""Good evening"". When I asked if anything was the matter she was slow to speak, covering her mouth with her hands so that I could barely understand her request for me to sit down at the table and talk a while.

""You know about my tuberculosis, don't you, and the work I am supposed to be doing for the doctor in his dispensary.""

""Yes, I know. Have they told you to leave?""

""Oh, no, it is not that. I am not really consumptive. I am sure the doctor just said that to make me work for him; he knows that I can't get a job anywhere else after being declared consumptive. You see, there is really no dispensary here at all and the doctor does not even intend to establish one. I have tried to ask him for work, but he doesn't understand my poor English. Won't you please speak to him about it? Ask him to get me some work and a girl to keep me company at night.""

I did not like the idea of prying into matters that did not concern me, and since Aiko seemed to be accusing the doctor of some vague foul play, I hesitated to approach him without a much better case to present. At the same time, I have run into many misunderstandings which arose simply from language difficulties, and felt obliged to offer myself as an interpreter in getting the matter straightened out. I indicated to Aiko that her story was a little hard to believe. Trying to get at the heart of things, I asked what reason the doctor had in keeping her on.

She started to cry. ""The doctor forces me to sleep with him.""

""Forces you to sleep with him?""

""Yes"", she sobbed.

I wondered what could be done or said about such a delicate problem. Aiko thought my puzzled look meant that I did not believe her. She pulled me up by the sleeve.

""Come with me.""

I followed uneasily. Through my mind ran a suspicion that the girl's distress might be faked, a device to get me alone with her in the dispensary.

We entered a suite of rooms, over the door to which was painted, in English and Japanese, the word ""Dispensary"". Inside I found a scene which quickly dispelled my doubts--a little love nest of makeshift couches, a whisky closet fairly well stocked with ""Suntory"" Scotch and some American liquors, a few novels and miscellaneous furniture which could hardly have been put to any medical use. The doctor had apparently been drinking and playing solitaire. Dirty glasses and cards were strewn about the table. Most convincing of all was a .45 pistol lying among the cards. I stared at it. Aiko murmured, ""He threatened me with that pistol"".

Plainly Aiko was not deceiving me, but those sordid surroundings made me very uneasy, and I left quickly, pausing outside the door just long enough to make sure of the sign above it: ""Dispensary"". As we hastened back down the hallway, she begged me to write a note to the doctor in English. She did not wish to sleep with him that night because she was menstruating. I had a little difficulty over the Japanese word *mensu*, which I realized later was borrowed from the West, and my difficulty was heightened by her female embarrassment in explaining what she meant. After the note was written (it said she ""would appreciate waiting a few days before going further with the doctor""), I agreed to meet her again in the morning and promised that I would bring enough yen for her to buy a ticket to her home in the North. 

Aiko must have left very early the next morning because she did not meet me as planned and I have not seen her since. 

The whole experience shook me pretty hard at first, but I guess nothing can be done about it now. Americans have an awful lot of power over people here, and those who want to misuse it can do our cause plenty of damage without getting caught.

All my love,

""I wonder what the Morris incident will look like in history fifty years from now. Consider these circumstances: that here at our own doors the mighty insurance upheaval has not settled down to a level yet. Even yesterday, and day before, the discredited millionaire insurance magnates had not all been flung out and buried from sight under the maledictions of the nation, but some of the McCurdies, McCalls, Hydes, and Alexanders were still lingering in positions of trust, such as directorships in banks. Also we have to-day the whole nation's attention centered upon the Standard Oil corporation, the most prodigious commercial force existing upon the planet. All the American world are standing breathless and wondering if the Standard Oil is going to come out of its Missourian battle crippled, and if crippled, how much crippled. Also we have Congress threatening to overhaul the Panama Canal Commission to see what it has done with the fifty-nine millions, and to find out what it proposes to do with the recently added eleven millions. Also there are three or four other matters of colossal public interest on the board to-day. And on the other side of the ocean we have Church and State separated in France; we have a threat of war between France and Germany upon the Morocco question; we have a crushed revolution in Russia, with the Tsar and his family of thieves--the grand dukes--recovering from their long fright and beginning to butcher the remnants of the revolutionaries in the old confident way that was the Russian way in former days for three centuries; we have China furnishing a solemn and awful mystery. Nobody knows what it is, but we are sending three regiments in a hurry from the Philippines to China, under the generalship of Funston, the man who captured Aguinaldo by methods which would disgrace the lowest blatherskite that is doing time in any penitentiary. Nobody seems to know what the Chinese mystery is, but everybody seems to think that a giant convulsion is impending there.

That is the menu as it stands to-day. These are the things which offer themselves to the world's attention to-day. Apparently they are large enough to leave no space for smaller matters, yet the Morris incident comes up and blots the whole thing out. The Morris incident is making a flurry in Congress, and for several days now it has been rioting through the imagination of the American nation and setting every tongue afire with excited talk. This autobiography will not see the light of print until after my death. I do not know when that is going to happen, and do not feel a large interest in the matter, anyway. It may be some years yet, but if it does not occur within the next three months I am confident that by that time the nation, encountering the Morris incident in my autobiography, would be trying to remember what the incident was, and not succeeding. That incident, which is so large to-day, will be so small three or four months from now it will then have taken its place with the abortive Russian revolution and these other large matters, and nobody will be able to tell one from the other by difference of size.""",1643302139.0,2022-01-27 16:48:59+00:00

I  have always been particularly fascinated by the long and rich history  of Ancient Egypt. I don't think I have to explain how long and rich it  is on this subreddit, but recently I have been doing some digging and  found a question I can't answer: what exactly made them so successful?

Some  background to my question: It seems to be generally accepted that  Ancient Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power/civilisation during the  New Kingdom period (1549 BC - 1069 BC). By this time, they had already  been around for well over a millenium, and even if their decline started  then, it would take until 30 BC before Egypt became a Roman province at  the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Altogether, this civilisation existed  for more than three millennia. The only other civilisation that I know  of that comes close to this is the Maya civilisation, which arose during  the Preclassic period (ca. 2000 BC). It suffered from a collapse during  the 9th century BC, followed by the much diminished Postclassic period  that lasted until the Spanish conquest in the 16th and 17th century.

The  longevity of these civilisations is something that has always impressed  me deeply and I have been trying to come up with explanations myself,  such as the presence of fertile land or natural barriers to keep  invaders out. However, these 'explanations' seem to be insufficient, as these geographical features are not unique by any means.

There's a popularly believed historical narrative that I've read in many websites and articles,that The Origins of The April Fools Day were the persecution + expulsion of Muslims by Catholic Monarchs. The so-called historical narrative as following:

>**Don't be fooled by April Fools: Expulsion & Bloody Genocide of Muslims, Spain and 1st April 1492.**  
In Spain, after centuries of Muslim rule, the Muslims were overwhelmed by the Christian Army,led by Catholic Monarchs. However,on 31th March (*When The Decree of Expulsion was issued by The Catholic Monarchs*), the Muslims hid & they were fortified in their homes. The Christian Armies wanted to get rid of the Muslims somehow. The Christians told the Muslims that the Muslims could leave their homes safely and could take only the necessary things from their homes. Muslims also were told that they could sail away from Iberian Peninusla in the ships anchored on the quay side with the royal safeguard from The Christians and The Catholic Monarchs on their expulsion. The Muslims did wonder and they were skeptical if this ploy was a trick by The Catholic Monarchs and their armies.Then,Muslims were requested to go to the quay side to check the ships. Later,Muslims did so and were convinced. Then Muslims made preparations to leave. The next day, 1st April, Muslims took their essential belongings and walked towards the quay side. But then,The Christians,perpetrated by Catholic Monarchs suddenly sieged & encircled The Muslims from all directions. The Christians looted their homes and then set fire to them. Before the Muslims got to the ships, the Christians had set fire to the ships as well. The Christians then attacked the Muslims and massacred them all without mercy at all,including men, women and children. Consequently,all Iberian Muslims in the port were brutally massacred. Blood pooled everywhere,and The blue-colored sea had turned blackish red,because their corpses were dumped into the sea. So,The Muslims were totally fooled & massacred *en masse* by Ferdinand,Isabella,and their armies on 1st April! Since then,the Christians then celebrated this massacre event on 1st April (a.k.a April Fools!). This then became a ritual that was celebrated every year and that has been carried on until this day not only in Spain but in other countries, too. People on this world celebrate 1st April as well as playing jokes on others on this day through sheer ignorance of this historical fact. We should bring out the facts of the story to all in order to put a stop to the practice of celebrating this bloody and shameful episode.

I'm very skeptical on this popular historical narrative. Some websites say this ""Bloody Muslim Massacre / Genocide on 1st April"" happened on 1st of April 1487,while some say this happened on 1st of April 1492. But,as far as I know,The Alhambra Decree expulsed Jews only. It wasn't until 1502 that The Muslims were expulsed,and it wasn't until 1582 that the tradition of April Fools' day began. Although,The Siege of Malaga did happen. But The Siege of Malaga happened 7 May 1487 until 18 August 1487,not 1st of April 1487.

Well,but I could be wrong. But is there any truth inside this popular historical narrative,or is this whole narrative just a fabricated story / lie?",1642861681.0,2022-01-22 14:28:01+00:00
964,Napoleon was not defeated by the Russian winter,40,s9rqmf,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/s9rqmf/napoleon_was_not_defeated_by_the_russian_winter/,49,"Napoleon's 1812 Invasion of Russia began with the Crossing of the Nieman River on June 24th. In the first two weeks of the campaign, Napoleon lost an estimated 100,000 men to disease and desertion; by the end of the first five, his army was down to half its original size.

After a series of attempts bring the retreating Russians to a decisive battle, the largest clash of the campaign, Borodino, was fought on September 7th, 75 kilometers from Moscow. The French failed to fully defeat the Russians, who continued to retreat, abandoning Moscow.

Napoleon entered Moscow on September 14th, and left it with 100,000 men on October 19th, when he realized that the Tsar would not make peace. The battle of Maloyaroslavets, fought on October 24th, forced Napoleon to retreat along the same route he had used to reach Moscow. At this point, when the infamous winter retreat \*began\*, Napoleon's army numbered fewer than 100,000 men; perhaps a fifth of the force he invaded with.

The Bulk of Napoleon's army was lost well before the winter set in, and the idea that he invaded in winter is a complete falsehood. The real killers of Napoleon's Grande Armee were disease (most notably typhus), desertion, severe heat, and rain, exacerbated by the Emperor's demands for rapid marches in his search for a decisive battle to quickly end the campaign.

&#x200B;

I'm not 100% if this belongs here, but I'm striking out elsewhere and my google-fu is failing. I'm trying to do some research on plants used throughout history in various areas, and I guess I have no idea where to start without getting extremely granular (like searching every potential plant one by one rather than by potential usage).

I'd imagine that the fact that not all of a countries resources go into the war matters (population, natural resources etc), like maybe China only had about 1% of their population fighting and another 1% making supplies and then Japan had like 20% of each making supplies and fighting so it balances out? I imagine though, when it comes down to it, let's say we were fighting aliens who sent trillions of drones to fight us, it would come down to the biggest country faring better. Like if you have 1 billion people, you can reverse engineer the drones faster with more scientists and build some faster?

Coming on the coattails of the Spanish-American War, where the stated goal of the U.S. was to free Spanish colonies from the tyranny of the Spanish Imperial governments, why did the U.S. immediately turn around and fight a war against the Philippine people, who, once free of the Spanish Tyranny, formed their own elected government and declared independence?  

I would say it was the imperial ambitions of the U.S. at the time, but the U.S. government turned right around 14 years after it ended and said, ""Oh yeah, we're going to give you independence at some point"" with the passage of the Jones Act.  From what I've read of the Spanish-American War, McKinley wasn't actually enthusiastic about fighting it even though his Congress was, so I don't what what the impetus for the U.S. trying to hold onto the Philippines was from a foreign policy perspective.  From what little bit I can gather of Philippine-American War, it seems like General Otis may have gone a little overboard or off the reservation.  I also can't find anything about the U.S. wanting any kind of precious natural resources from the Philippines.

On empathy and true Americanism:

>I do not think that a man is fit to do good work in our American democracy unless he is able to have a genuine fellow-feeling for, understanding of, and sympathy with his fellow-Americans, whatever their creed or their birthplace, the section in which they live, or the work which they do, provided they possess the only kind of Americanism that really counts, the Americanism of the spirit.

On career politicians:

>I did not believe, and I do not now believe, that any man should ever attempt to make politics his only career. It is a dreadful misfortune for a man to grow to feel that his whole livelihood and whole happiness depend upon his staying in office. Such a feeling prevents him from being of real service to the people while in office, and always puts him under the heaviest of pressure to barter his convictions for the sake of holding office. 

On the average citizen vs the career politician elites:

>As a result of our wrong thinking and supineness, we American citizens tend to breed a mass of men whose interests in governmental matters are often adverse to ours, who are thoroughly drilled, thoroughly organised, who make their livelihood out of politics, and who frequently make their livelihood out of *bad* politics. They know every little twist and turn, no matter how intricate, in the politics of their several wards, and when election day comes the ordinary citizen has merely the interest that all good men, all decent citizens, should have in political life, finds himself as helpless before these men as if he were a solitary volunteer in the presence of a band of drilled mercenaries on a field of battle. 

On corporations:

>It was very early borne in upon me that almost equal harm was done by indiscriminate defense of, and indiscriminate attack on, corporations. It was hard to say whether the man who prided himself upons always antagonising the corporations, or the man who, on the plea that he was a good conservative, always stood up for them, was the more mischievous agent of corruption and demoralisation.

On only criticising the wealthy:

>We grew to heartily distrust the reformer who never denounced wickedness unless it was embodied in a rich man. Human nature does not change, and that type of ""reformer"" is as noxious now as he ever was. The loud-mouthed upholder of popular rights who attacks wickedness only when it is allied with wealth, and who never publicly assails any misdeed, no matter how flagrant, if committed nominally in the interest of labour, has either a warped mind or a tainted soul, and should be trusted by no honest man. 

On opposing labour:

>As a matter of fact, we found that it needed much more courage to stand up openly against labour men when they were wrong than against capitalists when they were wrong. The sins against labour are usually committed, and the improper services to capitalists are usually rendered, behind closed doors. Very often the man with the moral courage to speak in the open against labour when it is wrong is the only man anxious to do effective work for labour when labour is right.

On how to be a great politician:

>There are plenty of decent legislators, and plenty of able legislators; but the blamelessness and the fighting edge are not always combined. Both qualities are necessary for the man who is to wage active battle against the powers that prey. He must be clean of life, so that he can laugh when his public or his private record is searched; and yet being clean of life will not avail him if he is either foolish or timid. He must walk warily and fearlessly, and while he should never brawl if he can avoid it, he must be ready to hit hard if the need arises. Let him remember, by the way, that the unforgivable crime is soft hitting. Do not hit at all if it can be avoided; but never hit softly. 

On understanding lower-class peoples' support for local corrupt leaders:

>He may be a very bad and very corrupt man, a man whose action in blackmailing and protecting vice is of far-reaching damage to his constituents. But these constituents are for the most part men and women who struggle hard against poverty and with whom the problem of living is very real and very close. They would prefer clean and honest government, if this clean and honest government is accompanied by human sympathy, human understanding. But an appeal made to them for virtue in the abstract, an appeal made by good men who do not really understand their needs, will often pass quite unheeded, if on the other side stands the boss, the friend and benefactor, who may have been guilty of much wrong-doing in things that are hardly aware concern them, but who appeals to them, no only for the sake of favours to come, but in the name of gratitude and loyalty, and above all of understanding and fellow-feeling. They have a feeling of clan-loyalty to him; his and their relations may be sustantially those which are right and proper among primitive people still in the clan stage of moral development. The successful fight against this type of vicious boss, and the type of vicious politics which produces it, can be made only by men who have a genuine fellow-feeling for and understanding of the people for and with whom they are to work, and who in practical fashion seek their social and industrial benefit. 

On being impartial in politics:

>My duty was to stand with every one while he was right, and to stand against him when he went wrong; and this I have tried to do as regards individuals and as regards groups of individuals. When a business man or labour leader, politician or reformer, is right, I support him; when he goes wrong, I leave him. The principles or methods which the Socialists advocate and which I believe to be in the interest of the people I support, and those which I believe to be against the interest of the people I oppose.

On forgiving people who worked in corrupt institutions:

>There are many good, unimaginative citizens who in politics or in business act in accordance with accepted standards, in a matter-of-course way, without questioning these standards; until something happens which sharply arouses them to the situation, whereupon they try to work for better things. The proper course in such event is to let bygones be bygones, and if the men prove by their actions the sincerity of their conversion, heartily to work with them for the betterment of business and political conditions.

On law and unlawfulness:

>If there were wrongs, I would join with a full heart in striving to have them corrected. But where there was violence all other questions had to drop until order was restored. This is a democracy, and the people have the power, if they choose to exercise it, to make conditions as they ought to be made, and to do this strictly within the law; and therefore the first duty of the true democrat, of the man really loyal to the principles of popular government, is to see that law is enforced and order upheld.

On criminal rehabilitation:

>When the criminal has been punished, if he then shows a sincere desire to lead a decent and upright life, he should be given the chance, he should be helped and not hindered; and if he makes good, he should receive that respect from others which so ofte aids in creating self-respect - the most invaluable of all possessons.

On cowardly moralists:

>Yet there were misguided professional philanthropists who cared so much more for names than for facts that they preferred a ""peace"" of continuous murder to a ""war"" which stopped the murder and brought real peace.

On just wars:

>The true preacers of peace, who strive earnestly to bring nearer the day when peace shall obtain among all peoples, and who really do help forward the cause, are men who never hesitate to choose righteous war when it is the only alternative to unrighteous peace.

On standards:

>There must be a raising of standards, and not a leveling down to the standard of the poorest and most inefficient.

On votes:

>A vote is like a rifle: its usefulness depends upon the character of the user.

On ungrateful husbands:

An example I've heard is a knight might court a noble woman while at the same time going into a village, seeing a woman they liked and then raping her without any sort a repercussions.

Were knights more viewed as terrorizer and peasants a subjugated people? Almost akin to the Spartans and the Helots?

Now the late medieval period does cover hundreds of year and I'm sure different states had different laws and so on but I'm wondering about how the average person would have viewed nobility. 

I feel there's a sort of narrative that tries to depicts knights as righteous and honorable but is this largely a myth?",1642623064.0,2022-01-19 20:11:04+00:00

I know that the FBI was made in 1908 so i want to know what was the Investigator or Detective type group that scared criminals, so far ive only managed to find a group of national detectives called the Pinkertons, since they appearently had spies

also Abraham Lincoln hired Pinkerton guards to protect him after he found out that they foiled a plan to assasinate him, they could do security guard stuff to private military contracting, so what do you think? Were the pinkertons the FBI of the wild west or do you think that there were other groups that deserve the title of the Wild West FBI?",1642695142.0,2022-01-20 16:12:22+00:00
984,Why did the Western Roman Empire choose Burgundians and Goths over Egidius,49,s82tpk,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/s82tpk/why_did_the_western_roman_empire_choose/,7,"So its interesting how in the reign of Libius Severus and Ricimer; the empire decides to fight Egidius with the help of the settled Goths. 

What was that about? 

Ravenna promised the Goths the port city of Narbonne in exchange for helping crush Egidius. 

Now I understand that Egidius was seen as a usurper carving out his own little kingdom in Gaul, but wouldn't it make more sense to team up with your fellow Roman and crush the Goths altogether? 

A joint army of the Gallic and Italian troops could have easily taken down the Goths. One pushing from the east, another pushing from the north. 

There was also the Burgundians who got Lyons in exchange for fighting Egidius as well. 

But this whole thing seems to ridiculous to believe. Why would the western roman government give land to the barbarian Burgundians and Goths in exchange for fighting a fellow Roman who had the support of Constantinople? 

It seems so petty and counterproductive.",1642632145.0,2022-01-19 22:42:25+00:00

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",1642597216.0,2022-01-19 13:00:16+00:00

But what got me wondering was its use in battle.

I could not find any resource talking about sieges or tactical uses of the Chateau. The only reference is about its involvement during theAlbigensian Crusade against the Cathar heresy on the 13th century.

My assumption is that it'd be near to impossible to invaded it without artillery and still very hard even with guns. But that would be necessary, as it also seems to me that maintaining supply of the castle, its small area and impractical sorties.

I imagine it being used as a very strong position to defend a lord from a stronger force while waiting for reinforcements .

Maybe it was little used, but there are similar structures that can reveal what's its intended use.

But I don't have anything to back or correct this assumptions, so I ask you.",1642604313.0,2022-01-19 14:58:33+00:00

989,Looking for community members to strengthen the moderator team.,442,s6uca4,history,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/s6uca4/looking_for_community_members_to_strengthen_the/,38,"Hi! 

As a more serious large subreddit it takes a lot of work to maintain /r/history. This also means that we are [always looking to add a few more mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/mod_application)  to the /r/history team. 

Because it is easy to overlook the link in the sidebar we also make one of these posts once in a while. Feel free to ask any questions. 

## What do we expect from \/r/history moderators?

Here is a quick overview of the general things we are looking for: 

- **Experienced with reddit and \/r/history:** We are looking for experienced redditors who have been active on reddit with an account that is at least 1 year old. In addition to that we are looking for people who have contributed productively to this community. 
- **A firm interest in history:** We want people that are interested in the subject, so obviously you need to have a firm interest in history. 
- **Communicative towards users and fellow moderators:** You will communicate with other users on a regular basis, for this you need to be communicative, mature and civil. Lots of mod decisions are discussed in our backroom subreddit, modmail and discord, so you will need to be able to work well together with the other team members. 
- **Free time:** You don't need to have a ton of time on your hands, but when you get accepted you should have enough time to actually carry out moderating duties. 
- **Thick skin:** history is a subject people often try to use to push their agenda. When they are not allowed to do so they can get rather nasty. 
- **Willingness to install and use third party tools:** This includes browser extensions aimed at mods as found on /r/toolbox which are essential for moderating as well as using applications for chatting with the team on discord. 

Some of the responsibilities include: 

- Review unmoderated links and modqueue reports and remove off topic and rule breaking content.
- Answer subscriber questions in modmail.
- Enforce sidebar rules.

If you have no idea how moderating works on reddit and want to check out more about that first you can have a look at [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/historymod101).

## What do I get in return?
